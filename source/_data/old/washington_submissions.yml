- abstract: '            The Georgetown University Library is experimenting with the
    IIIF presentation API in order to provide a compelling interface for a number
    of existing collection types especially for collections that are difficult to
    represent in the item/object model hierarchy provided by our repository.  In particular,
    it has been difficult to represent archival collections without item metadata
    as items in a repository.             <br/>  <br/>             The Georgetown
    University Library has enhanced our existing metadata automation tool (File Analyzer)
    to generate IIIF manifest files enriched with metadata from existing import/export
    files used by our repository systems:             <br/>             (1) DSpace
    metadata import and export files: dublin_core.xml and mets.xml             <br/>             (2)
    Encoded Archival Description Files (EAD) generated from Archivist Toolkit and
    ArchivesSpace             <br/>             (3) CSV files             <br/>             (4)
    DSpace REST API             <br/>  <br/>             In addition to embedding
    item metadata into a manifest file, the manifest generator can also be configured
    to sequence manifest canvases and generate manifest ranges for a collection of
    objects based on metadata values.             <br/>  <br/>             The application
    has been designed to enable our digital services team to iteratively enhance object
    metadata and view the results in the Universal Viewer.             <br/>  <br/>             While
    the existing File Analyzer application had been primarily designed to support
    the digital workflows at Georgetown, our hope is to enhance the application to
    support digital workflows used by other institutions.             <br/>  <br/>             The
    presentation will illustrate a variety of manifest files that have been generated
    at Georgetown using this application.  The presentation will also include a live
    demonstration of the manifest generation process.             <br/>  <br/>             The
    code for the File Analyzer application is available on the Georgetown University
    Library GitHub page.  The following tutorial illustrates the capabilities that
    are available within the application.  Attendees will be able to download the
    application, the tutorial, and the tutorial test data in order to try out the
    application for themselves.             <br/>  <br/>             https://github.com/Georgetown-University-Libraries/File-Analyzer-Test-Data/blob/master/iiif/README.md             <br/>  '

- abstract: '            This lightning talk will illustrate several examples from
    the last year in which the Princeton University Art Museum has used IIIF APIs
    and IIIF-adjacent technologies and viewers (Image API, Presentation API, Mirador)
    to reinvigorate tech-deprecated or hard to maintain in-gallery and online experiences.
    Like many museums, after years of investment in boutique digital features and
    experiences Princeton found itself faced with a portfolio of under-documented,
    standalone projects that existed completely apart from the museum''s recently
    revamped technology stack and architecture. While still relevant in terms of content
    and still looked upon favorably by visitors and curators, these digital projects
    were often built with technologies (notably, Flash) that were no longer able to
    be modified, nor did they take advantage of years of advances in imaging and web
    technologies. Observing that many of the experiences they provided were image-oriented
    and could be (if not totally in design than in spirit) replicated using IIIF,
    the Museum elected to do so - the ultimate result being a set of digital features
    that take advantage of the capabilities of the IIIF APIs and are far more sustainable
    in terms of the Museum''s ability to support, modify, and replicate them for future
    use.            '

  type: 7 minute lightning talk to be given in a plenary session
- abstract: '            The automated generation of IIIF manifests is relatively
    simple for objects with single images, but for paged material the lack of detailed
    structure in the catalogue record prevents us easily creating manifests with the
    necessary sequence information. Additionally some objects may need to combine
    information from records across the institution (e.g. from the museum and library),
    in which case neither catalogue has the full structural information (for example
    when we are creating a digital reconstruction of a new dis-bound volume part catalogued
    in both the museum & library).             <br/>  <br/>             We have developed
    a tool that lets us combine information from the different V&A cataloging systems
    with a lightweight YAML configuration file to generate these complex IIIF manifests.
    This lets us rapidly regenerate manifests based on a combination of the source
    metadata with structural information that can be easily updated and corrected
    as the digital reconstruction is viewed.             <br/>  <br/>             Although
    this has been developed with our systems, it could be re-purposed to work for
    other museum cataloguing systems.            '

- abstract: "            The Swedish National Archives has a public web service (https://sok.riksarkivet.se)\
    \ that enables researchers to search the National Archival Database (NAD) and\
    \ other publicly available databases and also to view images from digitized Swedish\
    \ archival collections. During 2015 and 2016 new functionality for viewing digital\
    \ images has been developed. The new system is based on the open source project\
    \ \u201CUniversal Viewer\u201D (https://github.com/UniversalViewer). The National\
    \ Archives has participated in the project together with the British Library,\
    \ the Wellcome Library and others.             <br/>  <br/>             The Universal\
    \ Viewer based application for viewing images retrieves the images from an IIIF-server.\
    \ The IIIF-server has been implemented in house by the National Archives following\
    \ the IIIF-standard. A major reason for implementing IIIF for image access was\
    \ a desire to make the image viewing application independent of image formats.\
    \ The IIIF-server accesses images both in JPEG- and DjVU-format. The DjVU-format\
    \ has been in extensive use within the National Archives but because the format\
    \ has lost support in web browsers there was a need to build a solution that solved\
    \ this problem. The application DPSS from Cuminas is used to instantly convert\
    \ DjVU-files to JPEG when they are requested through the IIIF-server. This solution\
    \ has made it possible to implement a new application for image viewing that can\
    \ be used on all devices without having to do a major conversion of all existing\
    \ DjVu-images to JPEG.             <br/>  <br/>             On the 1st of February\
    \ 2018 the National Archives digital images became accessible free of charge.\
    \ Before that date researchers had to pay a fee to access images. Because of the\
    \ expected increase in image access the architecture for image access had to be\
    \ upgraded. Currently the search application runs on an MSWindows webserver. The\
    \ image viewing application accesses a pool of 13 IIIF-servers working in parallel\
    \ fronted by a load balancing cluster consisting of two servers. The images (both\
    \ JPEG and DjVu) are stored in an object store based on the Hitachi Content Platform\
    \ (HCP). The search engine is implemented with SOLR and MSSQL Server is used as\
    \ the database engine.             <br/>  <br/>             The National Archives\
    \ has about 200 million digitized images of which about 100 million are publicly\
    \ accessible. The new image viewing system based on Universal Viewer and IIIF\
    \ has worked very well. It withstood the onslaught on the 1st February when the\
    \ images became free to view. Currently the work load is approximately three times\
    \ the work load before the 1st of February.             <br/>  <br/>         \
    \    The National Archives is currently digitizing analogue audio- and video-recordings\
    \ in collaboration with the Royal Library. During 2018 the possibility to show\
    \ and play audio- and video-recordings will be added to the online search service.\
    \ The same basic architecture will be used, Universal Viewer as the client application\
    \ and the IIIF-servers for file access. The IIIF-implementation has to be modified\
    \ to allow retrieval of audio-and video-files. We are very interested in other\
    \ efforts to use IIIF for audio and video.             <br/>  <br/>  "

    that may not be with contemporary cultural sensitivity in mind; they were described
    within a framework that is problematic vis-a-vis contemporary standards; or they
    were added to/deaccessed from/complemented via varying decision-making protocols.

  topic:
  - Discovery of IIIF resources
  - Emerging use cases for IIIF technical specifications
  type: 60 minute discussion
- abstract: "            The field of heritage science is truly multidisciplinary,\
    \ with collaborations and scientific data being captured from diverse fields such\
    \ as; materials science, archaeology, botany, biology, engineering, physics and\
    \ chemistry. The challenge for data in the heritage realm working across disciplines,\
    \ is sharing this not only with other scientific partners, but making it available\
    \ within the cultural humanities. This requires an interoperable platform, ease\
    \ of use, sustainable access, open source file formats, and the capacity for a\
    \ more integrated approach to data visualization.             <br/>          \
    \   This use case of heritage science is a prototype for assessing the capabilities\
    \ of the IIIF canvas for integrating and layering different views of the same\
    \ data, while adding cross-disciplinary annotations, and other linked data as\
    \ additional layers and annotation. Many related fields and disciplines have begun\
    \ to focus on the need to integrate and assess approaches from other scientific\
    \ colleagues \u2013 while also recognizing the necessity to engage and learn from\
    \ the humanities, since the data being generated by both groups of scholars is\
    \ simply viewed from different perspectives. An initiative for linked scientific\
    \ data generated from heritage materials has been developed within the Library\
    \ of Congress Preservation Research and Testing Division. A relational database\
    \ integrating all different types of scientific analyses links these back to the\
    \ original heritage object, building upon existing standards and authorities.\
    \ What makes this approach an effective digital tool, is being able to link the\
    \ various data layers back to a single heritage object with the digital rendition\
    \ being seen as a \u201Cdigital cultural object\u201D (DCO) that becomes the digital\
    \ connection back to the original. This object centric approach allows for a discussion\
    \ platform for shared data from colleagues.             <br/>             Since\
    \ images convey so much information, the base scientific data is a stack of spectral\
    \ imaging data layers \u2013 capturing the response of materials to different\
    \ visible and non-visible illumination. Turning on and off layers within the Mirador\
    \ viewer allows comparison of layers within the stack, with additional non-invasive\
    \ scientific data as annotations. These include X-ray fluorescence (XRF) to determine\
    \ inorganic elements present, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for\
    \ organic structural information, fiber optic reflectance spectroscopy FORS) for\
    \ molecular and separation of inks, binder and pigments This rich volume of data\
    \ is augmented with descriptive metadata describing the data layers and annotations\
    \ to allow better understanding of the cultural object \u2013 what materials have\
    \ been used?, how was the object constructed?, has it changed over time?     \
    \        <br/>             Improving the utility of existing IIIF capabilities\
    \ can expand the resources for museums, archives, libraries and other cultural\
    \ institutions, as well as enabling better collaboration with academic partners.\
    \ Some of the challenges still under discussion and development include accurate\
    \ X, Y coordinate and geospatial location for layering and adding scientific analyses\
    \ to the base canvas image, being able to annotate individual layers, inputting\
    \ specific file formats, extracting and including embedded metadata, and the capability\
    \ to add structured metadata.            "

    communities as technologies have improved.  Much development of 3D applications
    is siloed, and cutting-edge activities are largely happening outside the library
    and cultural heritage realm. 3D data cover a wide-range of file formats and applications
    for research and outreach.             <br/>  <br/>             The IIIF 3D community
    group provides an opportunity for institutions interested in interoperability
    to coordinate strategies and facilitate conversations about open standards that
    support 3D use cases. Many of the desired operations and interactions with 3D
    data are similar to the 2D and A/V use cases of IIIF for sharing images and annotation,
    and organizations are increasingly looking to integrate exhibits, displays, and
    comparisons of 3D data with other file types.             <br/>  <br/>             The
    goals of the IIIF 3D community group are:             <br/>  <br/>             *
    To explore possibilities for viewing, search, discovery, and annotating 3D data.             <br/>             *
    To collect and document use cases from existing and new IIIF community members

- abstract: '            Adding the concept of curation to the world of IIIF will
    enrich user''s experience for expressing and sharing their interests and creativity.
    We define curation as a user-generated collection of the whole or part of images
    across multiple sources, typically under a theme, and optionally with a meaningful
    ordering. The idea of curation, however, is excluded from the current IIIF APIs,
    because IIIF has evolved from the necessity of accessing a book, whose structure
    is defined by a physical object. The structure of curation, on the other hand,
    can be defined by users where the only constraint is their imagination. To introduce
    this flexibility to IIIF, we decided to design a new API called Curation API that
    allows more fine-grained units of distribution, such as ranges and canvases. We
    have been developing an open source software implementation, IIIF Curation Viewer,
    for studying the applicability of the specification and demonstrating the value
    of curations. We also have been developing an open source software, JSONkeeper,
    to store a curation in JSON-LD format, and to provide curations for search and
    discovery services. At present, IIIF Curation Viewer has functionality to add
    metadata to curated canvases, which will be used in the future for searching interesting
    canvases from diverse viewpoints. We also plan to explore curation''s inter-linking
    structure across multiple manifests, which leads to taking advantage of the linked
    data aspect of IIIF. Finally, as the summary of our activities at Center for Open
    Data in the Humanities (CODH), we introduce other specifications we proposed,
    namely Timeline API and Cursor API, designed for scientific applications in mind.            '

- abstract: '            JPEG2000 is widely used as a delivery format for IIIF servers
    due to its intelligent decompression, and lossless compression makes it possible
    to use the same file as a long-term preservation format. However, digitisation
    tools and workflows still rely heavily on the TIFF format, necessitating a conversion
    from TIFF to JPEG 2000. For long-term preservation, we must ensure this conversion
    is lossless, both for the image data and for its associated metadata.             <br/>  <br/>             For
    our Digital Bodleian service we discovered a critical flaw in our conversion process
    that resulted in non-reversible conversions between TIFF and JPEG 2000 due to
    incorrect handling of colour profile information. To correct this, we re-examined
    our conversion process and set up a rigorous test suite to ensure our new method
    would not have similar problems. In this talk we will provide an overview of our
    new conversion process, designed to ensure fully lossless conversions between
    TIFF and JPEG 2000. Of particular note will be a discussion of how colour profile
    data should be handled to ensure images retain their original colour and are not
    inadvertently, and irreversibly, cast to an incorrect colour space.             <br/>  <br/>             We
    will also introduce a new open source Python library that converts a TIFF or JPEG
    to JPEG2000 using the Kakadu library, with an emphasis on digital preservation.
    This library includes automated checks that the conversion was completely reversible,
    on both the pixel and embedded metadata level.            '

- abstract: '            The University of Edinburgh has a large heritage collection,
    including art, museum objects, archives, rare books and manuscripts.  The rare
    book and manuscript collections are substantial, with over 400,000 rare books,
    some 300 Western medieval manuscripts and 700 Oriental manuscripts.  Up to now
    only around 2% of the collection has been digitised but we are now investing significantly
    in digitisation and have developed a Digitisation Strategy to prioritise work.  The
    focus is on how we can unlock these unique resources to support the teaching and
    research of the University and the interests of the wider community, all in line
    with our open by default approach.  From the RBMS collections we have identified
    as a priority for digitisation our iconics collection of star items such as the
    Celtic Psalter (probably the oldest surviving Scottish book still in Scotland).             <br/>  <br/>             However,
    we have identified that digitisation on its own is not sufficient to allow people
    to find and use this content.  Particularly as regards the RBMS collections, there
    is a lack of good existing metadata and even when this is available the current
    image management systems do not draw on this effectively.  Images are presented
    in isolation without contextual description, and consequently act more as decorative
    objects rather than as research resources.  We felt that this collection lent
    itself to further experimentation with the IIIF model not just as a presentational
    tool, but as an approach to improve discoverability and usability.             <br/>  <br/>             Our
    image repository is very useful for image management, storage and "availability",
    but doesn''t fit perfectly within our overall data/discovery solution. It is a
    IIIF compliant server though, and we have an existing model for creating logical,
    faceted, collections-based websites, supplied from  CMS data. We aim to use that
    model to source this content.             <br/>  <br/>             The shelfmark
    is a logical means of grouping items to drive the generation of manifests, and
    is a good starting point (the Presentation API allows us to push beyond this).
    Because we are able to generate manifests dynamically, we can then push them into
    a repository which offers a persistent  reference from other systems.             <br/>  <br/>             Further
    to this, we want the book-level data that we display to be correct, which means
    sourcing it from the library catalogue, and not simply picking up data from image
    records which are not subject to the same rigour. To this end, we are looking
    at making use of the ways to allow us to pull in library catalogue data, be it
    in MARC, RDF or JSON-LD form.             <br/>  <br/>             IIIF has other
    uses for us in this sphere: we are conscious that not everything digitised necessarily
    fits this model, and we can explain how IIIF can help with that content. We also
    realise it can help us identify cataloguing and digitisation gaps within the collections.             <br/>  <br/>             Finally,
    given the rich and varied nature of the Rare Books and Manuscripts we''d like
    to show that IIIF can meet the needs of complicated presentation material- the
    75m-long Mahabharata Scroll- and has allowed us to capture translations and transcriptions.            '

    \ is a one-year project coordinated at the Haute \xE9cole de gestion de Gen\xE8\
    ve (HEG-GE) which wants to address the issue of raising awareness and knowledge\
    \ of IIIF, especially within Swiss institutions in the cultural heritage field.\
    \             <br/>  <br/>             It has been conceived to help Swiss institutions\
    \ in implementing IIIF-conform solutions and exposing their digital collections\
    \ in a more flexible, sustainable and interoperable manner through APIs.     \
    \        <br/>  <br/>             The following objectives have been considered:\
    \             <br/>  <br/>             - Reviewing the existing technology stacks\
    \ and deployed APIs in the cultural heritage field in Switzerland            \
    \ <br/>             - Performing a needs assessment and a gap analysis by means\
    \ of surveys and interviews             <br/>             - Writing a technical\
    \ white paper which includes a requirements analysis and a set of recommendations\

- abstract: '            Images capture human attention. When digital images circulate
    on the web, people often gather information from the visual content alone. There
    may be embedded metadata in an image, perhaps automatically generated by the digital
    camera the photographer used. People do not often embed descriptive metadata into
    digital images they share online. While the IIIF Presentation API does not require
    much metadata, some image contributors need to communicate complex metadata. The
    standards for image application programming interfaces (APIs) that the International
    Image Interoperability Framework (IIF) created provide guidance for how to communicate
    metadata along with images on the web.             <br/>  <br/>             We
    introduce a linked data application to demonstrate the power of publishing metadata
    along with digital images. We use images and text to tell stories in this application
    related to the lives of women involved in scientific research before 1969. Many
    of these stories have not yet been told on the web, we aim to raise their profile.             <br/>  <br/>             We
    propose to present a web application that integrates a Cantaloupe image server
    and the Universal Viewer. The manifests we present are linked to the semantic
    web through our reuse of resource URIs from the Wikidata knowledge base. We converted
    metadata from Yale University Library (YUL), YUL''s department of Manuscripts
    and Archives, and Yale Peabody Museum into linked open data to bring together
    materials related to women in science that is currently fragmented across campus
    collections. We will describe the data curation, the architecture of the web application,
    and we will demonstrate how the concepts presented here relate to larger themes
    in digital scholarship and science communication.             <br/>  <br/>             Science
    communication of the twenty-first century allows us to reconnect images and complex
    metadata in a web presentation. We will demonstrate how free software and open
    standards can be leveraged to create visually appealing interactive information
    experiences that will allow for people to extend science communication to social
    spaces on the web.             <br/>  '

    \ was released nearly two years ago, we have yet to see a strong community engaged\
    \ and invested in its implementation. This session will be a focused technical\
    \ discussion for developers, implementers, and technical stakeholders around implementation\
    \ strategies for the Content Search API. Participants need not have implemented\
    \ the Content Search API, but should at least have a basic familiarity with the\
    \ specification and its scope. The session leaders will provide brief introductions\
    \ (20 minutes of presentations total) about their existing implementations, and\
    \ invite any other implementers of the specification to speak briefly about their\
    \ experience. Following the introduction of current implementations, we will lead\
    \ a facilitated discussion in which we hope to answer the following questions:\
    \             <br/>  <br/>             * Are there approaches, code, or design\
    \ patterns that can be shared throughout the IIIF community to inform implementations?\

    \ does a Content Search API implementation need to align with the behavior of\

    \ search across objects)?             <br/>             * What would a static/\u201D\

    \ solution to the IIIF conference             <br/>             which suggested\
    \ a standard service block attached to Manifest objects that provided a venue\
    \ for the             <br/>             supplements the scholarly community may\
    \ want to attach. In 2017, the Linked Data Notification             <br/>    \
    \         standard was selected from among others (WebMentions, Activity Streams,\
    \ pingback, etc.) and             <br/>             implemented in a general,\
    \ centralized LDN Inbox, not requiring individual institutions to host and   \
    \          <br/>             maintain their own services. This Rerum Inbox, hosted\
    \ by  The Walter J. Ong, S.J. Center for             <br/>             Digital\
    \ Humanities (OngCDH), has been in operation since last August, receiving Announcements\
    \ from             <br/>             the scholarly community and serving as the\
    \ fallback Inbox for the Mirador LDN Plugin (implemented             <br/>   \
    \          at http://mirador.scta.info/) written by Jeffrey Witt. In startling\
    \ fact, this has \"just worked\" for             <br/>             many supplements\
    \ to Manifests... so long as they are Ranges indicating Table of Contents.   \
    \          <br/>  <br/>             Jeffrey Witt and Patrick Cuba (Lead Developer,\
    \ OngCDH) recognized that the Rerum Inbox did not             <br/>          \
    \   restrict what types of Announcements could be made, but the plugin was not\
    \ able to render diverse             <br/>             supplements into the Mirador\
    \ viewer. In response, the Mirador LDN Inbox has been extended to detect     \
    \        <br/>             and augment Layers and AnnotationLists for annotations\
    \ created in popular tools for transcriptions.             <br/>             In\
    \ addition, inbox-docs.rerum.io has been updated with simple web forms (including\
    \ Drag n' Drop) to             <br/>             allow anyone to poll the Inbox\
    \ for Announcements on a digital resource identifier or to create a new      \
    \       <br/>             Announcement without using the command line or some\
    \ cUrl utility.             <br/>  <br/>             In this presentation, a quick\
    \ demonstration of the existing Inbox+Mirador functionality will be          \
    \   <br/>             done, accompanied by a conversation exploring the additional\
    \ applications of the LDN standard.             <br/>             Rerum Inbox\
    \ enforces no specific bias, so the conventions of the community become the de\
    \ facto             <br/>             standard without limiting experimentation.\
    \ Jeffrey Witt is already working on an extension to his             <br/>   \
    \          useful plugin that exposes the results of peer review for supplemental\
    \ content. Several popular             <br/>             transcription applications\
    \ (TPEN, FromThePage, TEI Web Editor) are working towards exposing           \
    \  <br/>             transcription projects through LDN, both to contribute completed\
    \ transcriptions and to leave a             <br/>             calling card on\
    \ works in progress, allowing other scholars to discover existing efforts and\
    \ new             <br/>             communities. Previous conversations among\
    \ developers have considered error logging for malformed or             <br/>\
    \             unavailable Manifests to be important and difficult, but there is\
    \ space in an LDN Inbox for these             <br/>             Announcements.\
    \ Even if the only short-term advances were to enrich the Mirador and other IIIF\
    \             <br/>             viewers with content for tables of contents; to\
    \ describe physical structures (such as leaf Ranges);             <br/>      \
    \       to supplement with intentional Layers for transcription, commentary, and\
    \ annotation; to offer richer             <br/>             descriptions and metadata;\
    \ and to attach additional service blocks for searching, transcoding, or     \
    \        <br/>             visualizing resources\u2014it would be well worth the\
    \ effort.            "

    transcribing, painting, commenting\u2014but there is also space for experimental\

    \ and changeable things insists of airtight versioning and authentication, but\
    \ encourages (rather than enforces) strict compliance to standards and conventions,\

    Annotation W3C standards, Natural Language Processing, community-sourced tags
    and annotations, and generous interfaces to bring to Indigenous peoples of New
    Mexico and beyond access to government records related to their individual, family,
    and community histories. Newly launched, our initial offerings focus on records
    related to land and water rights and the build up to and operation of the government
    Indian boarding schools, 1850s-1930s. Boarding school documents now include administrative
    and policy records from across the nation, including Carlisle and Standing Rock.
    In partnership with the New Mexico State Library Tribal Libraries Program and
    the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center, an organization of all 19 Pueblos, we are adding
    to this resource, encouraging volunteers interested to learn and work collaboratively
    online, and supporting our pilot cohort of Indigenous Digital Archive Fellows
    from the tribes to made model contributions to inspire and energize others. IIIF''s
    emphasis on interoperability allows also viewing and working with related records

- abstract: "            One of the great challenges for a center that builds digital\
    \ tools are the base costs of developing any project from the front to back end.\
    \ Building unique silos is not only scholarly self-defeating but financially wasteful.\
    \ By leveraging IIIF and taking a module approach, The Walter J, Ong, S.J. Center\
    \ for Digital Humanities is working smarter and progressively cheaper. As a case\
    \ in point OngCDH adapted its TPEN (a digital transcription application) for the\
    \ Newberry Library Digital French Paleography project. By looking beyond the first\
    \ project to allow for other language-specific projects OngCDH reduced the cost\
    \ to a third of the original project.             <br/>             We considered\
    \ our project in three phases.  OngCDH changed the back-end of T-PEN (already\
    \ IIIIF compliant) into web services. We then built a custom interface deployed\
    \ in the University of Toronto Library\u2019s Drupal site that contains the Newberry\
    \ French Paleography project. Finally, we launched our open public annotation\
    \ store that allows for storing those annotations produced in the Newberry French\
    \ Paleography project. The combination of the three has allowed OngCDH to leverage\
    \ the IIIF standard to solve the needs of the Newberry for a transcription application,\
    \ but also addresses the future expansion of the Newberry\u2019s digital paleography\
    \ programs by creating a more easily customized and deployable interface without\
    \ the need to replicate the back end for every instance, thereby reducing cost\
    \ to maintain and to update all instances within the growing Newberry digital\
    \ paleography space. OngCDH now has a prebuilt back-end and an initial group of\
    \ web components that, when combined with existing web components built by others\
    \ in the IIIF community, are already moving quickly and more cost effectively\
    \ to new project solutions while continuing to maintain the principle of sharing\

- abstract: '            Although it isn''t a national library, nor is it located
    on a major university''s campus, the Folger Shakespeare Library joined the IIIF
    Consortium as a founding member because it sees the benefits of community participation
    and shared technology. Because of the Folger''s internationally-recognized work
    on early modern books and manuscripts, and its role in fostering the study of
    early modern culture, the Folger can invite the thousands of scholars who use
    its collections to use IIIF resources in their own work and encourage their home
    institutions to incorporate IIIF-compatible technologies.             <br/>  <br/>             The
    Folger has also begun promoting the Consortium to other independent cultural institutions
    which might not have considered participating. This talk -- directed in part towards
    institutions that are considering their commitment to IIIF -- will outline the
    benefits that the Folger expects to realize from the community, as well as the
    expertise it can contribute. It will demonstrate the first stage of the library''s
    incorporation of IIIF standards into its systems and long-term planning, and point
    towards future projects (most of them in partnership with other institutions)

    \ provided the opportunity to present our diverse digital holdings to a wide range\
    \ of users, from die-hard Shakespeare fans and students just discovering the Bard\
    \ for the first time, to genealogists hunting family history and specialist researchers\
    \ interested in our more esoteric collections materials. In this talk, we will\
    \ highlight case studies from across our digital landscape that provide functionality\
    \ for users with radically different motivations and levels of engagement. By\
    \ implementing IIIF, we hope users will more easily discover and reuse our materials,\
    \ placing them in new contexts and bring to bear new modes of analysis.      \
    \       <br/>  <br/>             Highlights will include a wordpress plugin that\
    \ makes it easy for website builders to deploy our IIIF-compliant images in web\
    \ pages with minimal technological expertise; The Early Modern Manuscripts Online\
    \ (EMMO) reading interface, which pairs IIIF images with thoroughly vetted, TEI-encoded\
    \ transcriptions of early modern texts to aid paleographic instruction and research;\
    \ and our use of viewers to show our multimedia materials alongside materials\
    \ from collections at other institutions.             <br/>  <br/>           \
    \  We see two major themes emerging as we hypothesize and test use-cases for our\
    \ deployment of IIIF: the reuse of IIIF materials as the building blocks that\
    \ diverse populations can use to tell their own stories about our collection and\
    \ the early modern period, and the use of our holdings for individual research.\
    \ Digital storytelling often requires users to bring together a number of images,\
    \ videos, and texts and juxtapose them to create a narrative. Once our wordpress\
    \ plugin is complete, students working on a project might design a website that\
    \ pulls together IIIF-compliant material from our bills of morality, a memento\
    \ mori engraving, and printed and manuscript elegies to begin to tell a story\
    \ about the experience of death and mourning in the early modern period. Personal\
    \ research, on the other hand, benefits from being able to do a wider range of\
    \ actions to precisely identified and documented items. In exploring the types\
    \ of image manipulation that might serve our users, we\u2019re considering the\
    \ researcher who wishes not only to rotate and zoom on an early modern letter\
    \ to facilitate transcription, but also perhaps overlay it with a radiograph or\
    \ transmitted light image for watermark analysis, or identify the position of\
    \ such a watermark by annotation.             <br/>  <br/>             For each\
    \ of these use cases, and more besides, we are interested in how we can make the\
    \ experience seamless and unified, no matter which viewer is implemented or what\
    \ is being done with it. We look forward to feedback from audience members to\
    \ help nuance and diversify our use case scenarios, and explore what IIIF may\
    \ offer our audiences.            "

    Vue.js.  Since the main purpose of the file manager is setting IIIF properties,
    such as the order of pages, viewing hints and direction, using the IIIF manifest
    was a natural fit.  This allowed us to remove a redundant JSON serialization that
    our old file manager was using, and lets our new file manager work with IIIF instead
    of with our application''s internals.  We hope to be able to package this file
    manager for reuse in other IIIF-based applications.             <br/>  '

    \ metadata at page level (sequence, labels of foliation or caption and description\
    \ of illustration, text as range). Additional metadata can be created on IIIF-delivered\
    \ images through the use of image analysis[4]. In our projects, they are at page\
    \ level to pre-analyze the book contents (page classification: binding, calendar,\
    \ full-page miniature, text\u2026), or at infra-page level (layout and line segmentation),\
    \ infra-line and infra-word (word and letter recognition, expansion of abbreviations,\
    \ letterform classification). This use case implements diverse parts of the model\
    \ (collection, manifest, canvas, sequence, range, annotation). The annotations\
    \ foster the need for their presentation at page level (e.g. color frames in mosaic\
    \ view, creation of alternative manifests, implementation of alternative sequences\
    \ or the newly defined \u2018unordered\u2019 property[5]). Multiple readings also\
    \ require being able to classify the annotations to search, retrieve, and present\
    \ separately (for example) lines/words/letters, graphetic/normalized transcriptions,\
    \ or indexing data according to confidence level.             <br/>  <br/>   \
    \          Data formats, granularity and interaction             <br/>       \
    \      Text-image alignment from TEI editions and the presentation in IIIF annotations\
    \ are feasible (Example 4). However, issues with impoverishing edition formats\
    \ are stated [6], [7]. The Oriflamms TEI-compliant format is based on stand-off\
    \ encoding for shape classification and text-image alignment. Parallel developments\
    \ could be implemented in IIIF. Issues of image analysis and data formats are\
    \ to be particularly addressed while considering interaction, that is not only\
    \ exporting rich data into IIIF plain text, but annotating and interacting with\
    \ image and as text exported data to qualify and enhance the original data at\
    \ the adequate granularity level of TEI edition. Different interfaces are needed\
    \ depending on text or image analysis (IIIF interface to interact with \u201C\
    graphic\u201D information, XML-based interface for textual/semantic information);\
    \ the latter having to acknowledge cognitive issues (annotating snippet views\
    \ rather than whole pages). As in Oriflamms, a solution may be built integrating\
    \ several open source software, but it proves difficult to maintain through several\
    \ developing cycles.             <br/>  <br/>             [1] http://oriflamms.hypotheses.org/1592\

- abstract: '            Access to primary sources of law has been identified by advocates
    of open data as a fundamental right of citizens of a free society. Unfortunately,
    realizing that vision remains a largely unmet goal. Some remaining barriers include:
    bureaucracy that regulates access with paid subscription models; the inability
    of holding institutions to digitize collections due to time or resource constraints;
    and file formats that prevent efficient machine processing. Recent efforts by
    universities, the Library of Congress, and the federal and state governments have
    improved the situation somewhat by building digital collections of these materials
    with raw images and their transcriptions. While this is a step in the right direction,
    the resulting user experience (UX) often leaves much to be desired. IIIF can enable
    complex navigation operations within and across legal works by allowing the representation
    of cross-reference links and hierarchical index structures. By applying citation
    detection and other processing techniques to transcriptions of these materials,
    I aim to explore ways in which IIIF viewers could provide a UX more conducive
    to the viewing and study of legal works than the viewers presently in use.            '

- abstract: "            I\u2019d like to propose a presentation for the upcoming\
    \ IIIF Conference centred on the rebuilding and relaunch of the Parker Library\
    \ on the Web (hereafter referred to as Parker 2.0). Originally launched in 2008\
    \ in collaboration with the Cambridge University Library and Stanford University,\
    \ the Parker Library on the Web was one of the first sites to provide access to\
    \ a fully digitised manuscript collection, namely the 557 manuscripts held at\
    \ the Parker Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, as well as being one\
    \ of the first digitised manuscript libraries to be available via IIIF. Almost\
    \ 10 years later, we\u2019ve completely overhauled our site, ridding it of the\
    \ paywall that prevented our collections from being freely accessible, updating\
    \ and publishing our IIIF manifests, and incorporating a Mirador viewing window\
    \ and a Zotero-based bibliography structure.             <br/>  <br/>        \
    \     The presentation will consist of three distinct sections, each focused on\
    \ a different element of the design and implementation of the new site. In the\
    \ first section, I\u2019ll explore the challenges we faced in re-envisioning the\
    \ digital library as we sought to preserve the information that had been incorporated\
    \ into the original Parker on the Web interface, while creating something that\
    \ embraced both the best of Mirador and other open source software. We needed\
    \ to be able to incorporate large amounts of metadata, from summaries of a manuscript\u2019\
    s contents to detailed incipits and explicits for each of the texts, as well as\
    \ continue to provide features of the old site that were valued by our researchers,\
    \ such as pdfs of our physical catalogue records and the ability to navigate to\
    \ page level and search for manuscripts by number and by keyword.            \
    \ <br/>  <br/>             The second section will discuss the ways in which we\u2019\
    ve begun to use Parker 2.0 as an integral aspect of the physical Library. The\
    \ flexible nature of the new site makes it possible to build digital exhibitions\
    \ that parallel the exhibitions that we put on throughout the year, allowing those\
    \ who cannot make it to Cambridge to explore various aspects of the collection\
    \ and shine a light on some of our \u2018less popular\u2019 items. Additionally,\
    \ Parker 2.0 has made it possible to begin an internship programme that introduces\
    \ medieval history students to the rudiments of digital humanities as they create\
    \ tables of contents and annotations for some of our most famous manuscripts,\
    \ and to organise transcription workshops attended by students of all levels,\
    \ from first year undergraduates to post-doctoral researchers.             <br/>\
    \  <br/>             Finally, the paper will address how we want to take Parker\
    \ 2.0 forward in the coming year: providing digital options for encoding and searching\
    \ translations and transcriptions of various texts, creating opportunities for\
    \ more students to generate metadata, and thinking about ways to usefully search\
    \ by location, and, perhaps, use IIIF to pull in other copies of early printed\
    \ works from that we hold physically, yet have not had the opportunity to digitise.\

- abstract: '            Since 2011, Africa Media Online has been involved in the
    digitisation of the African National Congress Archives at the University of Fort
    Hare in Alice, Eastern Cape, South Africa. With close to 2 million pages and over
    80,000 photographs, the archive is largely paper-based but also includes a significant
    audio-visual component as well as museum objects. The longevity and size of the
    project has enabled Africa Media Online to invest in technologies to capture material
    at the internationally accepted standards and also to innovate in the area of
    preservation of, and access to, the digital files. This paper will give insight
    into the innovations leveraged by Africa Media Online with a focus on its implementation
    of IIIF.  The paper will also touch on how IIIF compliant technologies enhance
    both the digital preservation aspect of Africa Media Online''s MEMAT digital asset
    management system and the access aspect of the system. Africa Media Online has
    also developed an innovative platform for the outsourced capture of metadata for
    digitisation projects in Africa that utilizes open standards and a thesaurus that
    we have been developing called the African Archival Thesaurus. This system too
    will utilize IIIF compliant technologies to enable remote metadata capturers to
    interact with digital files. Part of this latter initiative has been to build
    a community of volunteers called the Metadata for Africa community, that we are
    hoping will enable access to underfunded and endangered African heritage resources.             <br/>  <br/>             Relevant

- abstract: "            The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is a mature standard for\
    \ representing text as XML, with widespread adoption in scholarly editing and\
    \ digital humanities communities.  Since many texts encoded in TEI represent transcriptions\
    \ and translations of documents with digital facsimiles, it seems logical that\
    \ TEI systems should use IIIF to display page images, and that IIIF systems use\
    \ TEI to represent texts.  But while there has been discussion of such linkages,\
    \ there has been little progress in defining gaps in the existing standards or\
    \ creating example implementations for projects to follow.             <br/> \
    \ <br/>             This presentation will review efforts by three projects to\
    \ use mixed IIIF+TEI data structures to establish interoperability of image and\
    \ text between Juxta Editions, FromThePage, and Engi-shiki and the lessons learned\
    \ from them. Juxta Editions is a web app that allows users to transcribe and mark\
    \ texts in TEI using an intuitive editing environment. In Juxta Editions, users\
    \ can generate diplomatic transcriptions of manuscripts, mark people, places,\
    \ and events, as well as structural features such as chapters. FromThePage is\
    \ a crowdsourcing platform that lets users import documents as IIIF manifests,\
    \ transcribe them, and export transcripts as TEI-XML. By identifying a TEI schema\
    \ and coding strategy that allows these two softwares to exchange texts, our hope\
    \ is to establish a best practice for coordinating text in TEI with IIIF resources.\
    \             <br/>  <br/>             The Engi-Shiki project aims to encode the\
    \ texts of the Engi-Shiki, which was compiled as an administrative manual in ancient\
    \ Japan around the 10th century.  It includes characteristics of ancient Chinese\
    \ and Japanese texts in the East Asian tradition. Dealing with Japanese materials\
    \ with Western-originated theoretical models, such as TEI and IIIF, should be\
    \ a touchstone to explore the possibility of IIIF as the research framework. Juxta\
    \ Editions and FromThePage will share documentation of our technical approach\
    \ with the Engi-Shiki project and to see how that approach interacts with their\
    \ editorial objectives.             <br/>  <br/>             The IIIF Presentation\
    \ API documentation notes a number of places where a IIIF file might logically\
    \ reference an XML representation of the text. However, there is not a recommendation\
    \ for how TEI texts should reference Presentation API elements. We will be primarily\
    \ considering use cases involving transcription of a primary source represented\
    \ with a facsimile. Should a TEI text point to a canvas or an Image API endpoint?\
    \ Is there a logical way to share annotations between TEI and IIIF representations?\
    \ We may also investigate surfaces and zones in TEI and where image coordinate\
    \ data should be best stored.             <br/>  <br/>             The results\
    \ of the three projects\u2019 combined efforts should present a model for mixed\
    \ TEI-IIIF projects targeting various types of texts to utilize IIIF for research\
    \ activities.             <br/>  "

- abstract: '            MarineLives is a user-driven content-creating project, run
    by volunteers. It is dedicated to collaborative transcription, linkage and enrichment
    of High Court of Admiralty manuscripts, 1627-1677, together with thematically
    related documents from international collections. Our corpus constitutes a powerful
    source of commercial, social, material, legal and linguistic insight. Our current
    platform is a SMW published under a CC BY 3.0 licence. It is built on semi-diplomatic
    transcription and folio-based page structure, which relates full text transcription
    directly to digital images.             <br/>  <br/>             Our vision for
    the next five years is to create a virtual manuscript-based archive and associated
    research community, which will foster a culture of collaborative scholarship.
    We plan to grow our full text corpus to twenty-five million words and our image
    collection to 50,000 images. As we scale up our activities, we are looking for
    new archival and library partners. We are registering a charitable incorporated
    organisation (Chronoscopic Education).             <br/>  <br/>             We
    are interested in technology tools, in collaborative potential of technology standards
    and platforms, and in communities of interest which are forming around them. Our
    approach to technology is pragmatic, cost-sensitive, and holistic. To date we
    have used low cost solutions to digitisation, platform technology and server infrastructure.
    With the formation of Chronoscopic Education, we recognise the need to increase
    funding, in particular to support our technology ambitions, whilst retaining the
    spirit of an entrepreneurially run social venture.             <br/>  <br/>             A
    major MarineLives research priority for 2018 and 2019 is the exploration of C17th
    literacy. Our goal is a technology-enabled manuscript community, focused on the
    topic of literacy.             <br/>  <br/>             We are working with social
    historian (Dr Mark Hailwood, Bristol), who is planning a 2019 major grant bid
    to explore literacy. We are reaching out to historians, linguists and archivists,
    using our extensive Twitter followership [@MarineLivesorg]. By publishing content
    under the hashtag #Occupationalsignatures contained in our MarineLives wiki, we
    are are building interest in literacy research amongst academics, archivists and
    the general public.             <br/>  <br/>             We are exploring the
    potential of IIIF standards, viewers and annotation tools to support our vision.
    We are developing an IIIF demo of manifests for markes, initials and signatures
    from multiple IIIF image servers (e.g. by occupation, type, year range), which
    we will use with historians and computer scientists as the starting point for
    a robust, flexible spec [Show demo].             <br/>  <br/>             In parallel,
    we are scaling up our involvement with Transkribus technology for spatial analysis
    of manuscripts and for handwriting recognition. An early experimenter with Transkribus,
    we have committed to increasing our ground base to 3 million words, targetting
    a character error rate of below 10%. We are particularly interested in integrating
    Transkribus spatial analysis of documents (text and line regions) with IIIF manifests
    and annotation capability.             <br/>  <br/>             Finally, we are
    designing a data study group, in consultation with the Alan Turing Institute and
    the University of Edinburgh, to scope out tools for pattern recognition of signatures
    and markes in historical manuscripts as a basis for sub-population identification.
    This data study group will use images and data sourced both from our IIIF and
    Transkribus experiments.            '

- abstract: "            In this talk, we present how we evaluate and visualize the\
    \ usage of IIIF-compatible images. We developed a script that analyzes IIIF Image\
    \ API call logs. The script generates heatmaps that visualize which parts of IIIF\
    \ images are looked intensively. The generated heatmaps are shown over images\
    \ using Mirador's layer functionality, so that users can seewhich parts of images\
    \ are focused. In addition, we report how long it takes to generate heatmaps and\
    \ how we tried to reduce computational costs.             <br/>             Furthermore,\
    \ we discuss how this heatmap generator can be deployed as a service for the IIIF\
    \ images. Generally speaking, visualization of access logs of web sites is not\
    \ a problem, if anonymization is conducted appropriately. We expect that the visualization\
    \ not only stimulates users\u2019 interests but also provides persuasive data\
    \ to maintain the service of publishing digital images. However, anonymization\
    \ can be invalidated for IIIF images that have few accesses. In addition, a series\
    \ of activities of a researcher on IIIF images in a collection might reveal his/her\
    \ viewpoint that would be a key issue of his/her academic outcome. Therefore,\
    \ access logs to IIIF images require a careful management to be used, in order\
    \ to make IIIF services be trusted by researchers. Since management of access\
    \ log to the IIIF images has various options, we might have to create a kind of\
    \ guidelines for it.            "

    \ to heterogeneous digital records such as the materials found in organizational\
    \ and personal archives? As a springboard to answering that question, this presentation\
    \ describes a collaborative project undertaken by staff members in Preservation,\
    \ IT, and University Archives at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\
    \ (UIUC) Library. Specifically, panelists will discuss specific ways that UIUC\
    \ is using the IIIF protocol and associated tools to develop an integrated web\
    \ service that exposes born digital content for easy ingest and description by\
    \ archives and library staff, as well as for intuitive browsing, search, and web\
    \ access for researchers.             <br/>  <br/>             The talk will begin\
    \ by comparing the archival approach of aggregate description of related digital\
    \ content to the library approach of exhaustive item-level metadata. Specific\
    \ examples will illustrate that is it possible to facilitate aggregate description\
    \ and access, while also allowing item-level description when warranted or useful.\
    \ The talk will continue with a demonstration of this theory put into practice,\
    \ with on overview of UIUC\u2019s Medusa repository architecture for the integrated\
    \ management of preservation and access. The Medusa system features a \u201Cfree-form\u201D\
    \ viewer for browsing born digital content, incorporating the IIIF protocol for\
    \ display of image files with the possibility of directory-level descriptions\
    \ for related content. As a result, Medusa provides the archivist with a broad\
    \ range of options for providing access to collections of born digital content,\
    \ including automatic extraction of metadata from source images, customizable\
    \ metadata profiles, and low (or even no) metadata requirements at the item level.\
    \ IIIF supplies a critical component of the browse and discovery environment for\
    \ these collections, and UIUC\u2019s IIIF implementation makes use of the locally\
    \ developed Canteloupe image server, a fast, easy-to-deploy option for the on-demand\
    \ generation of derivatives of high-resolution source images. The presentation\
    \ will conclude with a brief overview of Canteloupe for its growing community\
    \ of users.             <br/>  "

- abstract: "<p>Over the past few years, there has been much theoretical discussion around shareable and composable components\
    \ for building IIIF-friendly user interfaces. While individual projects are now moving towards composability,\
    \ these components have not proven to be shareable in practice. This session will be a focused technical discussion\
    \ for developers, implementers, and technical stakeholders around the practicality of shareable components, and some\
    \ of the issues that still need to be addressed. The session leaders will provide a brief overview (5 minutes) of the\
    \ 'vision', and some of the challenges we have faced. The rest of the session will consist of a discussion intended to\
    \ answer the following questions:</p>\
    \ <ul>\
    \ <li>What has prevented us from reusing components?</li>\
    \ <li>Where should the limited resources be spent in building IIIF tools that we can all use?</li>\
    \ <li>What are the limited resources?</li>\
    \ <li>What is the thin waist?</li>\
    \ <li>What components should be reusable and useful to others?</li>\
    \ <li>How do we define the boundaries between components? </li>\
    \ <li>Is this a matter of simply defining 'props' and 'actions' or is there more?</li>\
    \ <li>Do we need to be using 'Atomic Design' or similar Design System approaches?</li>\
    \ </ul>\
    \ <p>What does 'component utopia' look like, and what do we want to achieve by this time next year?</p><p>"
