  - abstract: "The University of Leeds Libraries and Digirati are building new infrastructure\
      \ for preservation and access to digitised and born digital content. We are\
      \ following a principle that would not have been possible even a few years ago\
      \ - that there is a standard at each end of the system: IIIF at the access end,\
      \ and The Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) at preservation end.<br/><br/>This\
      \ presentation briefly describes the design and implementation of the system\
      \ and the requirements of day-to-day operation in the near future, and then\
      \ considers what comprehension of the preserved material might look like in\
      \ the far future - if all you have left is the files, what can you make of it?\
      \ OCFL addresses recoverability and comprehension of the material as a preserved\
      \ object, but what, if anything, could IIIF do here? The runtime delivery of\
      \ IIIF at scale is at the opposite end of the system, it\u2019s an operational,\
      \ presentation concern, it could be turned off and on again. But is there a\
      \ place for some playable IIIF representation of an object to be part of preservation?\
      \ What would that look like? And what would be playing it?<br/><br/>"

  - abstract: 'The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens in LA has
      existed for over 100 years, and has amassed a huge amount of textual and image
      data to describe its collections. Furthermore, these holdings are extremely
      varied: living specimens in the case of its botanical collections; paintings
      and sculpture from its museum; rare books and digitized archives from its vast
      library.<br/><br/>This presented considerable challenges when surfacing a unified
      view of all of the collections, which launched to the public earlier this year.
      The aim of this presentation is to demonstrate how using IIIF standards, particularly
      the Image API, has enabled a flexible and evolving way to deal with variety
      of collections data, all while providing a consistent (and interoperable!) interface
      for users.<br/><br/>I particular, I will talk about some of the backend challenges
      in storing and serving image data from multiple internal systems during the
      prototype phase, and how these were simplified by switching to a consolidated
      image store, thanks to the use of a IIIF-capable DAMS. I will also demonstrate
      how settling on one standard for image delivery allowed us to provide a consistent
      interface for users, as well as easily reusable components for web developers.'

  - abstract: Africa Media Online (AMO) was the first organisation in Africa to adopt
      IIIF, building the Universal Viewer into the public web interface of its DAMS.
      The high speed of technological innovation around the world, particularly with
      the rapid adoption of AI technologies, meant that AMO abandoned the strategy
      of developing its own systems from scratch and in 2023 began to represent best
      of breed systems from elsewhere in the world into African markets. A number
      of the new systems do not incorporate IIIF. Seeing IIIF as a key component of
      what AMO wants to bring to the African market, with it's new technology partner,
      Code Pilot leading the development, AMO set out to integrate IIIF technologies
      with Wordpress and the Elementor visual builder to create a highly versatile
      web interface for any DAMS that has mature APIs. Since Wordpress is the most
      widely used website builder in the world, this integration between Wordpress
      and IIIF technologies in the new Memat 5 web interface promises not just to
      bring IIIF to the GLAM sector in Africa but also make it available to just about
      any economic sector anywhere in the World.

  - abstract: This presentation highlights two innovative projects that combine technology
      and accessibility. The first project involves transforming images into sound
      using Chladni patterns and machine learning. By applying machine learning techniques,
      we developed a method to convert visual images into sound, offering a multisensory
      experience that could benefit educational, artistic, and accessibility initiatives.
      The second project focuses on creating a 3D scanner for digital archiving of
      the University of Leeds' coin collection. The high-resolution scanner captures
      detailed features of coins, allowing for their preservation and global sharing.<br/><br/>Central
      to both projects is the use of the IIIF, which allows for high-quality image
      sharing and viewing across platforms. IIIF enables the democratization of university
      archives, which were previously inaccessible outside the institution. By integrating
      IIIF into these projects, we can share valuable content globally, expanding
      access to research, education, and collaboration.<br/><br/>These projects aim
      to revolutionize how digital content is shared, preserved, and interacted with.
      The ability to digitally document cultural artifacts like coins and convert
      visual art into sound not only preserves them but also creates new, accessible
      ways for people to engage with knowledge and history on a global scale.

  - abstract: Universities face challenges with presenting 3D content because of the
      fact that presenting 3D models is more difficult than 2D images since these
      models need specialized software and hardware to render and show them. Furthermore,
      hosting and presenting 3D content can be expensive, making it impractical for
      universities with little funding. However, when universities team up with the
      IIIF Community Group, together they can develop standards and best practices
      for 3D interoperability with the goal of making 3D content as easily shareable
      and accessible as 2D images. This is not only beneficial for educational experiences
      but also contributes to the overall objectives of digital preservation and access.

  - abstract: 3D data is more and more a common part of archaeological datasets. Hence,
      3D technologies should be integrated into the curricula to make archaeology
      students fit for an engagement with cultural heritage data. This presentation
      focuses on a class taught for archaeology students at the University of Basel
      which aimed at introducing them to the principles and practices of 3D modelling
      of buildings using open-source tools and standards. A complete workflow will
      be presented, starting from the creation of 3D models using Blender, the creation
      of rich accompanying metadata, paradata and state-of-the-art IIIF manifests,
      to the publication of the 3D models.<br/><br/>In addition to developing basic
      technical skills, the class aimed at addressing a critical need for the next
      generation of professionals in local museums, cantonal archaeologies, libraries
      and other cultural heritage institutions to embrace open and accessible data
      practices. By equipping students with the knowledge of 3D modelling and interoperable
      data standards such as IIIF, they are empowered to advocate for and implement
      more open approaches to managing cultural heritage data in the future. This
      is essential for fostering collaboration with researchers and greater accessibility
      of these data.<br/><br/>

      combining IIIF, Universal Viewer 4, and machine learning-based Handwritten Text
      Recognition (HTR) to improve access to historical documents. By integrating
      HTR-generated transcriptions through IIIF Content Search API, this solution
      enables full-text search within handwritten archival materials - a significant
      advance from traditional metadata-only searching. The presentation will demonstrate
      how this implementation fundamentally changes how users interact with archival
      content, making centuries of handwritten documents searchable and accessible
      to researchers, students, and the general public.<br/><br/>We will share our
      experience developing and deploying this system at scale, including technical

  - abstract: The University Library of Bern provides a IIIF service with a server
      infrastructure supporting Image and Presentation API (v2.1 & v3), a self-upload
      service for images and metadata and an administration website to manage uploads.
      The service is multi-client capable and scalable. A task management system automates
      the parallel processing of upload tasks from multiple projects. Imported images
      are converted to JPEGs in different predefined sizes. A user-friendly feature
      allows researchers to use the original source file name when accessing an image
      via the Image API. So, the researchers can use their existing information for
      the presentation without the need of mapping their information to the generated
      GUIDs.<br/><br/>This service was developed in collaboration with and upon request
      of a pilot project and the Digital Humanities Chair in Bern. Data stewards who
      are closely networked with (digital) humanities researchers, manage the communication
      and support of the service for researchers.<br/><br/>Our presentation will show
      our experience in developing and maintaining an institutional, multi-client
      capable IIIF service that provides a sustainable infrastructure solution for
      research projects with limited funding. We would like to share this experience
      with the IIIF community, as researchers in Bern find this service very valuable.

  - abstract: "IIIF was built upon the bedrock foundation of Medieval manuscripts,\
      \ whose excised illuminations were required to be readable. As things happen\
      \ in life and in libraries, the original use case of IIIF was outgrown by a\
      \ global supply of content and unforeseeable applications, and it has since\
      \ become a metonym for interoperability writ large. Looking forward to the next\
      \ decade of IIIF, we (The IIIF Community Group for Education) offer a complementary\
      \ trope based on ephemera, the curatorial category for short-lived transactional\
      \ print content, often on card stock. A flimsy edifice, admittedly, the \u201C\
      house of cards\u201D nevertheless stands up to withering scrutiny. It cautions\
      \ against unreliable dependencies for re-use. Conversely, it clarifies occasions\
      \ for long-term and term-limited user content. Ephemeral structures also bear\
      \ weight as a design metaphor for next generation standards, tools, and products\
      \ in immediate and transactional scenarios. Educational work products and user\
      \ groups are built up and torn down every semester, and lightweight, disposable\
      \ data management systems are well suited for these contexts. As examples, we\
      \ showcase LMS-based learning objects and our own \u201CMixtape\u201D aggregating\

      work is provenance and object research. Beyond manuscripts, IIIF viewers offer
      non-technical researchers the ability to closely analyze art objects they may
      not have physical access to across global institutions. In this talk, art librarian
      Annalise Welte will show an example used from instruction for a class on object
      research to highlight the importance and ease of use of IIIF on the user side.
      Other objects will be presented as direct use cases from art research instruction
      to demonstrate examples where IIIF developments, like work supporting 3D objects,
      will become crucial in the future.

  - abstract: The need for on-demand image resizing and transcoding and the concept
      of dynamic web-based image visualization and interoperability has existed since
      the introduction of image support in web browsers in the 1990's. A number of
      competing technologies were created to address this. However, over the last
      10 years, IIIF has emerged as the de-facto standard within the field of cultural
      heritage. The C2RMF was an early adopter of the concept of web-based image visualization
      for its image repository and has been a driver in the development of software
      for both image processing and visualization. In this presentation, therefore,
      we will take a look at how this has evolved not only at the C2RMF, but also
      more generally with an overview of the historical origins of IIIF-style image
      visualization and interoperability and how the technologies, image formats and
      APIs have evolved over the last 25 years. We will also look at examples of how
      advanced and complex scientific imaging types such as hyperspectral, macro-XRF
      and RTI have been integrated into the IIIF-based ecosystem.

      Digital Collections, we are now exploring fun and interesting ways to enhance
      the front-end experience and advance research through deeper applications of
      our IIIF APIs. This presentation will highlight how Northwestern generates on-the-fly
      IIIF Collections alongside search results in its digital collections, demonstrate
      an implementation of the Content State API that enables researchers to share
      point-in-time annotations, and explores how users from all backgrounds and levels
      of experience can collect and share these works through intuitively integrated
      features.

  - abstract: Global maritime projects depend on Marine Spatial Data Infrastructure
      to connect and use ocean information better across numerous systems. We face
      obstacles when making systems sustainable across three areas while keeping them
      accessible to everyone. The IIIF framework helps solve these problems to support
      marine data sharing and visualization. Our testing shows how 3D ocean mapping
      combined with AI-based data analysis helps protect marine life and ecosystems.
      Our research study looks at equal access practices for disabled people and underserved
      communities while establishing procedures to keep marine-based IIIF resources
      usable by future users. This presentation offers concrete solutions along with
      future predictions for adding MSDI to IIIF architecture to create more sustainable
      digital resources that everyone can access. Our presentation demonstrates IIIF's
      core objectives by presenting fresh implementation methods and accessibility
      options that benefit all users. Participants will learn how to use IIIF to build
      effective MSDI systems that help everyone while supporting worldwide marine
      spatial data goals.

  - abstract: "This work explores the implementation of the International Image Interoperability\
      \ Framework (IIIF) in developing a large-scale image-native archival resources\
      \ management system, addressing challenges in describing, analyzing and utilizing\
      \ scanned archival images. Traditional archival workflows often involve inefficient\
      \ manual descriptions, difficulties in processing unstructured data, and insufficient\
      \ fine-grained content disclosure. This work proposes a solution based on IIIF,\
      \ while leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools to enhance the\
      \ handling of archival images and related texts. The proposed system decomposes\
      \ the image development process into two workflows: the creation of an IIIF-conformed\
      \ image server using the IIIF Image API, followed by the usage of the IIIF Presentation\
      \ API for objectifying and encapsulating original images, in the form of Web\
      \ Annotations and further converting to schema based archival text. Using a\
      \ scientist\u2019s archival resources management system as a case study, the\
      \ system organizes IIIF objects of original images and OCR text as Digital Objects\
      \ within a standardized resource structure. This approach significantly enhances\

      \ containing metadata about 1.5 million books, journals, periodicals and dissertations\
      \ from the 1790 through 1962. In an effort to preserve the physical catalogue\
      \ and at the same time make it more accessible it was microfilmed and scanned\
      \ in the 1980\u2019s. An online representation of the catalogue exists but searching\
      \ it is difficult since none of the images are transcribed and the meta data\
      \ is limited. The primary objective of the project is to make records from K62\
      \ findable in the Swedish national library database Libris. Using AI to transcribe\
      \ the text in the scanned images will unlock the data. When the data is no longer\
      \ contained within the images it can be used, shared and linked to other data.\
      \ A secondary goal of this project is to link every K62 record in the Swedish\
      \ national library database back to the original image. A goal within that goal\
      \ is to display the image together with the AI transcribed text as annotations\
      \ using IIIF. This can be achieved by generating IIIF compatible annotation\

  - abstract: As trust and authenticity increasingly becomes a concern for all kinds
      of digital media content, we have been working toward a solution for addressing
      the problem of authenticating cultural heritage images. The Digital Object Authenticity
      Working Group (DOAWG) goal is to establish a method for displaying descriptive
      and technical process metadata for digital surrogates representing archival
      objects in an easily accessible and understandable way, and we believe that
      IIIF will serve as the perfect platform for displaying this metadata in order
      to track provenance and establish trust. In particular, our field is missing
      established methods for easily displaying metadata that represents information
      about the creation of the digital object, as well as verification methods for
      ensuring that the digital object is true to the original. Our plan to address
      these gaps is to use the International Press Telecommunication Council (IPTC)
      Photo Metadata Standard in conjunction with the ISO 19264-1 standard and content
      authentication tools developed by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity
      (C2PA). By publishing this metadata and verification within the widely-used
      IIIF framework, we believe that institutions can more easily share their collections
      ethically and securely, and end users can reliably access complete and accurate
      information.

  - abstract: 'Survey of India (SoI) maps produced from the eighteenth to mid-twentieth
      centuries hold immense value for archaeological research. Predating significant
      landscape changes, they have been found to document the locations of thousands
      of elevated mound features of potential archaeological importance. Copies of
      these map sheets are available in UK Deposit Libraries, however in most cases
      are subject to challenges of discoverability, findability and accessibility.
      These challenges mainly arise from these map sheets being available as paper
      maps or text-catalogued objects as opposed to open-access digital images with
      a geospatial search capability. The Mapping Archaeological Heritage in South
      Asia (MAHSA) project is using these map sheets to identify and document archaeological
      sites, and has developed a cross-platform interoperable geospatial search framework
      to address these challenges of discoverability, findability and accessibility.
      The implemented solution has arisen from collaborative work with Cambridge University
      Library and the British Library, who are extending the adoption of the International
      Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) to SoI map collections. MAHSA has generated
      detailed metadata for these map sheets and made the records available using
      the Arches database platform. The MAHSA Arches database links to the IIIF map
      images hosted by libraries and serves as a geospatial search interface. '

  - abstract: IIIF provides limited support for modelling books with moving parts
      (such as those with fold-outs and flaps). But could this support be extended
      to enable modelling of books with far more complex arrangements of moving (or
      sliding, rotating, popping, etc) parts? This Birds of a Feather session would
      be for those institutions and researchers with an interest in extending IIIF
      to help bring to life online books such as anatomical flap books, in which movable
      paper flaps are lifted to reveal the layers below, or books and manuscripts
      using other paper mechanisms such as folds, flaps, volvelles, pop-ups, etc.<br/><br/>We
      would like to review examples of works held in each institutions collections
      (please bring links to any examples you would like to share), we'll then discuss
      the viewing experience that scholars and users would desire for such items and
      the current limitations in the IIIF Presentation API for modelling these works.
      We can then consider what might be possible for IIIF to handle with the development
      of extensions to the current APIs. If there is enough interest, we would then
      propose a Community Group to continue the discussion of this topic.

    type: Birds of a Feather
  - abstract: Many of the core use cases of IIIF have been expressed not in terms
      of images and their presentation, but in terms of the digitized cultural heritage
      items. It has long been desirable to discover resources digitally available
      via IIIF by searching the properties and relationships of the real world objects,
      such as by creator, subject, classification or date. This Birds of a Feather
      session will discuss how organizations are using the Linked Art specification
      in conjunction with IIIF to obtain significant benefits through the joint adoption
      of these highly usable standards.<br/><br/>Linked Art has been designed and
      implemented over the past 5 years learning from and intentionally following
      the community best practices and design principles that IIIF has demonstrated
      to be so effective. It uses an existing, standard conceptual model and encodes
      knowledge using shared patterns in JSON-LD, made available via an easy to publish
      and consume web API. It has been adopted internationally by cultural heritage
      research and collecting institutions. We shall also discuss implementation experience
      and tools, and how to ensure the continued and rich connection between these
      overlapping communities and specifications.

  - abstract: "This workshop will train attendees to create and manage immersive online\
      \ exhibitions on the anaver.se web app through IIIF providers. No prior knowledge\
      \ or skill is required.<br/><br/>Following Biblioth\xE8que nationale de France\u2019\
      s (BnF) digital library Gallica upgrade to the IIIF v3.0 APIs, the web app anaver.se\
      \ has been made to support IIIF image resources. Its purpose is to allow both\
      \ online communities to make free use of the public domain online heritage and\
      \ to enable institutions to promote their online collections through professional\
      \ curation. Further improvements have widened its potential for interoperability,\
      \ including with institutions such as the Library of Congress or the Victoria\
      \ and Albert Museum IIIF endpoints. Users can hence mix different IIIF providers\
      \ in a same space.<br/><br/>At the end of the workshop, we expect attendees\
      \ to be able to:<br/>- Navigate the anaver.se (within a space and among spaces)<br/>-\
      \ Load and crop a IIIF asset within the anaver.se<br/>- Place, edit, and annotate\
      \ a IIIF asset in a space<br/>- Create an exhibition with several IIIF assets\
      \ in a space<br/>- Export an exhibition (also called a gallery) as a JSON file<br/>-\
      \ Import an existing exhibition<br/>- Manage a reserved space through the event\
      \ manager dashboard<br/><br/>"

    title: Creating an immersive exhibition with IIIF resources in the anaver.se
    type: Workshop
  - abstract: "The combination of Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) and the International\
      \ Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) holds great promise for how GLAM institutions\
      \ can provide access to its digitised collections. By combining large-scale\
      \ digitisation with ML-based text recognition, institutions can create searchable,\
      \ interoperable records that greatly enhance discoverability and user engagement.<br/><br/>In\
      \ this Birds of a Feather session, participants will explore practical examples\
      \ of implementing HTR within a IIIF ecosystem. Topics will include data preparation,\
      \ model training, and methods for integrating transcriptions into IIIF viewers,\
      \ supported by user feedback. Projects presented will include the Swedish National\
      \ Archives\u2019 solution for making HTR-transcribed historical manuscripts\
      \ searchable through IIIF, the Swiss Federal Archives' HTR-enabled workflow\
      \ for handwritten Federal Council minutes (1848-1903) that incorporates the\
      \ IIIF Content Search API, and The National Archives' (UK) approach to processing\
      \ wills (PROB 11), known for their relatively uniform handwriting style.<br/><br/>Open\
      \ to archivists, technologists and anyone interested in building more accessible\
      \ cultural heritage collections, this session will promote shared learning,\
      \ best practice and opportunities for collaboration within the IIIF community.\
      \ Whether you are new to HTR or refining existing approaches, join us to explore\
      \ new strategies, address common challenges, and help shape the future of archival\
      \ access."

    title: 'HTR + IIIF: Sharing Experiences and Best Practices'
    type: Birds of a Feather
  - abstract: Over the 10 years since its inception, IIIF has reached ever larger
      audiences, not just because of the global content or the sophisticated tools
      developed in its wake. It has also made research increasingly accessible to
      students. A new set of educational priorities has emerged in the IIIF sphere
      for pedagogies, foundational proficiencies, user-friendly technology, and faculty
      recruitment. This summer, in addition to hosting the IIIF Annual Conference,
      the University of Leeds is also launching our own IIIF collections, and embarking
      on a university-wide implementation effort. We are keen to encourage take-up
      of IIIF, but we know that for many involved in teaching and learning new technologies
      and practices can feel like a hurdle. In this session, the IIIF Education Community
      Group and representatives from the University of Leeds will share examples of
      IIIF-based learning materials, and facilitate discussion about holistic institutional
      implementation strategies. The session will be of interest to scholar-educators,
      and to those who provide educational support, such as Learning Technologists.
      Viewpoints from those with prior experience and those completely new to IIIF
      will be welcomed.
