  - abstract: 'This workshop proposes a full introduction to Arvest (https://arvest.app):
      an open source and free to use web app for researchers, teachers, students,
      artists and GLAM sector professionals who wish to work with multimodal corpora.
      Arvest is built entirely around IIIF, and allows anyone with an email address
      to immediately start engaging with and creating IIIF content. Make the most
      of a powerful set of features, from secure media and data hosting; to multimodal
      projects which can be shared and/or worked on collaboratively; to various types
      of annotations from simple text, to visual overlays, to time-based annotations;
      to a powerful API which allows you to integrate Arvest into complex computational
      workflows.'

    title: Introduction to Arvest
    type: Workshop
  - abstract: "This interactive tutorial workshop presents an overview of ARK (Archival\
      \ Resource Key) persistent identifiers, their cross-domain metadata, and unique\
      \ compatibility with IIIF applications. As non-paywalled PIDs (persistent identifiers,\
      \ permalinks) for information objects of any kind, ARKs support durable web\
      \ addresses (e.g., that don\u2019t return 404 Page Not Found). Persistent links\
      \ are especially important for protecting our investment in the linked data.\
      \ Since 2001, 8.2 billion ARKs have been created by over 1450 organizations\
      \ \u2014 libraries, data centers, archives, museums, publishers, government\
      \ agencies, and vendors. With highly flexible metadata, citation-friendly ARKs\
      \ identify anything digital, physical, or abstract. Important use cases include\
      \ ARKs for physical samples and for millions of items in national libraries\
      \ and museums of fine art and natural history. The tutorial includes hands-on\
      \ experience and is for anyone interested in PIDs supporting images and cross-domain\
      \ heritage data."

  - abstract: As IIIF continues to grow in importance and impact, great potentials
      for developments and applications of 3D media are explored in the 3D Community
      Group (CG) and 3D Technical Specification Group (TSG). The 3D TSG have advanced
      draft standards for 3D content, to complement and expand the potential of all
      IIIF-based collections. In this session we show you updated draft documents
      and release candidate, for review, input, and further testing with collection
      holders.<br/><br/>Complementing this, the 3D CG has examples of projects, tools
      and contacts with other 3D researchers and developer communities to collaboratively
      consider challenges and solutions in common. The IIIF 3D groups work together
      with specialists and representatives across user communities, international
      and standards bodies. Combined efforts are extending IIIF suitably and sustainably
      into the 3rd dimension, expanding options to overcome barriers for sustainable
      sharing across institutions and collections.<br/><br/>The TSG is evolving options
      for incorporation of 2D and A/V with 3D data, including for digital dioramas,
      scene construction considerations, and for a more inclusive and sustainable
      metaverse. This session will provide an update on the work and progress, use
      cases, demos and take-home examples, and technical specification for IIIF 3D
      and Presentation API 4.0. Please join us!

    type: Workshop
  - abstract: IIIF provides limited support for modelling books with moving parts
      (such as those with fold-outs and flaps). But could this support be extended
      to enable modelling of books with far more complex arrangements of moving (or
      sliding, rotating, popping, etc) parts? This Birds of a Feather session would
      be for those institutions and researchers with an interest in extending IIIF
      to help bring to life online books such as anatomical flap books, in which movable
      paper flaps are lifted to reveal the layers below, or books and manuscripts
      using other paper mechanisms such as folds, flaps, volvelles, pop-ups, etc.<br/><br/>We
      would like to review examples of works held in each institutions collections
      (please bring links to any examples you would like to share), we'll then discuss
      the viewing experience that scholars and users would desire for such items and
      the current limitations in the IIIF Presentation API for modelling these works.
      We can then consider what might be possible for IIIF to handle with the development
      of extensions to the current APIs. If there is enough interest, we would then
      propose a Community Group to continue the discussion of this topic.

  - abstract: "This workshop will train attendees to create and manage immersive online\
      \ exhibitions on the anaver.se web app through IIIF providers. No prior knowledge\
      \ or skill is required.<br/><br/>Following Biblioth\xE8que nationale de France\u2019\
      s (BnF) digital library Gallica upgrade to the IIIF v3.0 APIs, the web app anaver.se\
      \ has been made to support IIIF image resources. Its purpose is to allow both\
      \ online communities to make free use of the public domain online heritage and\
      \ to enable institutions to promote their online collections through professional\
      \ curation. Further improvements have widened its potential for interoperability,\
      \ including with institutions such as the Library of Congress or the Victoria\
      \ and Albert Museum IIIF endpoints. Users can hence mix different IIIF providers\
      \ in a same space.<br/><br/>At the end of the workshop, we expect attendees\
      \ to be able to:<br/>- Navigate the anaver.se (within a space and among spaces)<br/>-\
      \ Load and crop a IIIF asset within the anaver.se<br/>- Place, edit, and annotate\
      \ a IIIF asset in a space<br/>- Create an exhibition with several IIIF assets\
      \ in a space<br/>- Export an exhibition (also called a gallery) as a JSON file<br/>-\

  - abstract: "The combination of Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) and the International\
      \ Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) holds great promise for how GLAM institutions\
      \ can provide access to its digitised collections. By combining large-scale\
      \ digitisation with ML-based text recognition, institutions can create searchable,\
      \ interoperable records that greatly enhance discoverability and user engagement.<br/><br/>In\
      \ this Birds of a Feather session, participants will explore practical examples\
      \ of implementing HTR within a IIIF ecosystem. Topics will include data preparation,\
      \ model training, and methods for integrating transcriptions into IIIF viewers,\
      \ supported by user feedback. Projects presented will include the Swedish National\
      \ Archives\u2019 solution for making HTR-transcribed historical manuscripts\
      \ searchable through IIIF, the Swiss Federal Archives' HTR-enabled workflow\
      \ for handwritten Federal Council minutes (1848-1903) that incorporates the\
      \ IIIF Content Search API, and The National Archives' (UK) approach to processing\
      \ wills (PROB 11), known for their relatively uniform handwriting style.<br/><br/>Open\
      \ to archivists, technologists and anyone interested in building more accessible\
      \ cultural heritage collections, this session will promote shared learning,\
      \ best practice and opportunities for collaboration within the IIIF community.\
      \ Whether you are new to HTR or refining existing approaches, join us to explore\
      \ new strategies, address common challenges, and help shape the future of archival\
      \ access."

    title: 'HTR + IIIF: Sharing Experiences and Best Practices'
    type: Birds of a Feather
  - abstract: Over the 10 years since its inception, IIIF has reached ever larger
      audiences, not just because of the global content or the sophisticated tools
      developed in its wake. It has also made research increasingly accessible to
      students. A new set of educational priorities has emerged in the IIIF sphere
      for pedagogies, foundational proficiencies, user-friendly technology, and faculty
      recruitment. This summer, in addition to hosting the IIIF Annual Conference,
      the University of Leeds is also launching our own IIIF collections, and embarking
      on a university-wide implementation effort. We are keen to encourage take-up
      of IIIF, but we know that for many involved in teaching and learning new technologies
      and practices can feel like a hurdle. In this session, the IIIF Education Community
      Group and representatives from the University of Leeds will share examples of
      IIIF-based learning materials, and facilitate discussion about holistic institutional
      implementation strategies. The session will be of interest to scholar-educators,
      and to those who provide educational support, such as Learning Technologists.
      Viewpoints from those with prior experience and those completely new to IIIF
      will be welcomed.
