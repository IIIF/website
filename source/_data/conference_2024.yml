  - abstract: To complement the growing impact of IIIF in 2D and Audio/Video (A/V)
      collections around the world, the 3D Technical Specification Group (TSG) is
      meeting frequently to advance a draft of standards for 3D content, to complement
      and expand the potential of all IIIF-based collections. In addition, the 3D
      Community Group (CG) shares significant projects, tools and contacts with other
      3D researchers and developer communities to collaboratively consider challenges
      and potential solutions in common. The two IIIF 3D groups work together engaging
      with specialists and representatives across user communities, international
      and standards bodies, as outlined in their charters. The combined CG and TSG
      efforts are working to extend IIIF suitably into the 3rd dimension, expanding
      options for better data sharing across institutions and collections, to help
      overcome barriers for sustainable sharing. The TSG is determining workable options
      for incorporation of 2D and A/V with 3D data, including to enable digital dioramas
      (mini-metaverses), with considerations for scene and soundscape constructions,
      and the potential to help build a more inclusive and sustainable metaverse.
      This session will provide an update on the work and progress with use cases
      and technical specification drafting for the evolution of IIIF 3D. Please do
      join us!

  - abstract: Formerly known as the IIIF React Media Player, <a href='https://github.com/samvera-labs/ramp/'>Ramp</a>
      is a IIIF viewer for audiovisual materials that supports the IIIF Presentation
      3.0 API. It is an exportable NPM component library that provides ReactJS components
      for media playback, structures (table of contents) display, transcript presentation,
      metadata display, supplemental files, and highlighting annotations. A benefit
      of a component-based IIIF viewer is that individual implementations can choose
      which components to utilize and how to integrate them into their application.
      Ramp is now the primary media player for the Avalon Media System, providing
      nearly all item display functionality in Avalon.<br/><br/>In order to help community
      members with audiovisual media determine if Ramp would be useful for their needs,
      it has been added to the IIIF Viewer Matrix and has an up-to-date live demo
      site (<a href='https://ramp.avalonmediasystem.org/'>https://ramp.avalonmediasystem.org/</a>).<br/><br/>This
      presentation will provide an overview of Ramp and its constituent components
      and demonstrate how they are leveraged in the Avalon Media System. It will also
      provide an update on future work to broaden support for annotations and increase
      interoperability with AVAnnotate and Aviary, other producers of IIIF Presentation
      3.0 manifests for audiovisual media.<br/><br/>

  - abstract: "Existing interfaces presenting digitized map series leave much to be\
      \ desired. Navigation can be cumbersome and georeferenced versions break the\
      \ link to the original image. The combination of IIIF\u2019s Georeference Extension,\
      \ the open source ecosystem Allmaps, and a group of ambitious students has yielded\
      \ new methods for georeferencing map series and presenting them to a wider audience.\
      \ This was achieved by transcribing historical sources about the series, converting\
      \ geographic coordinates, using computer vision to detect the corners of the\
      \ map depicted on the image, and publishing the results as Georeference Annotations.<br/><br/>By\
      \ applying the methods to other map series in IIIF-compatible repositories,\
      \ their reusability is demonstrated. New features such as thin plate spline\
      \ transformation, distortion analysis to assess the accuracy of maps, and alternative\
      \ map projections will pass in review, as well as suggestions for how to publish\
      \ reusable information about map series as linked open data.<br/><br/>Last but\
      \ not least, Allmaps Arcade is introduced, a playful interface to encourage\
      \ public engagement with digitized map collections that can be configured with\
      \ a specific map series and geographic area. Players are asked to place sheets\
      \ in the right position and earn points based on speed and accuracy."

  - abstract: "In the early 20th century, Cave 17 in China’s Dunhuang Mogao Caves was unsealed, revealing thousands of manuscripts, documents, paintings and more that had lain undisturbed since their 11th century concealment. These artefacts, which have now become critical for understanding life along the Silk Roads in ancient Asia, were dispersed across institutions worldwide by early 1900s explorers.<br/><br/>
In the 90s, the International Dunhuang Programme (IDP) was formed to unite international partners in the pursuit of conserving, cataloguing, and digitising Eastern Silk Road collections – including the Dunhuang finds. The Programme also makes images and metadata accessible through the IDP database and website <a href='https://idp.bl.uk'>https://idp.bl.uk</a>. Thirty years later, the British Library contracted cultural sector digital specialists Surface Impression to update the IDP website in order to greatly enhance access to these collections worldwide. <br/><br/> 
IIIF was key to the new development, given its flexible presentation frameworks and its ability to dynamically handle dispersed items. But this project came with its own challenges! There are many uniquely formatted items in the collections, including the 5 metre (16.5’) wide Diamond Sutra scroll (a 200:1 aspect ratio), which required custom presentation solutions. <br/><br/>
This presentation explores creative and technical strategies for diverse materials within IIIF. It will examine how the IIIF community can innovate display methods while maintaining interoperability. It will be wide ranging and exploratory - including design, tech, viewers, curatorship and managing a complex digital project in the current technological landscape.

  - abstract: "We are living through yet another transformative era when the fundamental\
      \ drivers of Internet content creation, curation, and reuse are shifting as\
      \ massive AI and ML applications reform our shared digital landscape. In response\
      \ to these shifting sands, we need to rethink the ways we can best provide quality\
      \ research and reuse interactions for our richly described content shared through\
      \ IIIF APIs and related Manifests. The unregulated consumption of data and resources\
      \ by AI-powered bots and harvesters is increasingly more tenuous and challenges\
      \ our well established ideas of what openness means. We propose the implementation\
      \ of standardized \u201Cno-AI'' or \u201Cregulated AI\u201D tags in IIIF Manifests\
      \ that could be applied in repository environments across the globe. Similar\
      \ to the initiatives crafted by other creative content communities to limit\
      \ the scraping of images and text using \u201Cnoai\u201D and \u201Cnoimageai\u201D\
      \ meta HTML tags, we propose that the IIIF Community considers implementing\
      \ a set of tags within the standard IIIF API frameworks to help better regulate\
      \ AI/ML content scraping and non-consented or attributed use of IIIF powered\
      \ content in AI/ML applications. We strongly believe in the value of creating\
      \ consensus and shared practices in our own community for combating this significant\
      \ challenge. "

  - abstract: "Georeferencing, or the ability to match scanned images of maps to their\
      \ real-world geographies, has become an increasingly desirable workflow at map-holding\
      \ institutions. The Allmaps software ecosystem uses WebGL and IIIF to warp maps\
      \ on the client side of a web browser, reducing many of the barriers to georeferencing\
      \ that are inherent to traditional desktop georeferencing (e.g., ArcGIS, QGIS).\
      \ While Allmaps represents a next-generation tool for georeferencing, it is\
      \ not a panacea. In this presentation, we reflect on frictions that we\u2019\
      ve encountered when discussing Allmaps as a georeferencing solution with other\
      \ map-holding institutions, including its possibilities and the anxieties it\
      \ raises for prospective users. We begin with a brief overview of the Allmaps\
      \ software ecosystem, drawing concrete examples from the LMEC case to highlight\
      \ possibilities for using Allmaps with digital map collections. Then, we highlight\
      \ three anxieties that are commonly encountered when proposing Allmaps as a\
      \ georeferencing solution at other institutions. By way of conclusion, we sketch\
      \ out a governance structure for Allmaps - and potentially for other software\
      \ projects that use IIIF - that might ease some of these anxieties for prospective\
      \ users."

      academic technologists, librarians, instructional designers, museum professionals,
      and others to examine the ways IIIF resources and IIIF-related tools can be
      used as part of curriculum in Learning Management System (LMSs) and other online

    type: Lightning talk
  - abstract: There is a growing interest within cultural heritage organisations to
      understand the environmental impact of the infrastructure used to power the
      digital services accessed by the public. However, understanding the complexity
      behind this challenge involves breaking down the problem into well-defined and
      easily understood use cases that are common across the sector. At this point,
      we can begin to define the benchmarks, tools and techniques that help to generate
      data we require to start more informed discussions. The application of IIIF
      generates interesting use cases, such as the challenge of handling the large
      amounts of annotation data that result from the OCR of images at scale. In this
      talk, we will describe ongoing work to help understand this challenge and examine
      how the choice of technology can impact the digital footprint of a IIIF-related
      digital service. More specifically we will examine the performance of the annotation
      server <a href='https://github.com/nationalarchives/miiify'>Miiify</a> against
      some repeatable benchmarks when applied to real-world data at scale. The goal
      is to share our findings and hopefully generate further discussion and sharing
      of best practices within the field of green computing.<br/><br/>

  - abstract: This proposal outlines the development of tools to support the comparison
      of historical maps using IIIF, initiated by the Historiographical Institute,
      the University of Tokyo. This project focuses on the integration and comparative
      analysis of Japan's national pictorial maps and other significant maritime maps
      from the 15th century onwards. By leveraging IIIF, the proposed tools aim to
      facilitate a deeper understanding of historical maritime routes and geographical
      knowledge. We have developed Mirador plugins that use annotations to structure
      information on place names and maritime routes within the maps, supporting the
      comparative analysis of common elements across multiple maps. Furthermore, we
      have constructed visualization tools compliant with the IIIF Georeference Extension,
      enabling researchers to compare historical maps with modern geographical data
      without distortion. By emphasizing open-source accessibility, these tools promise
      to enhance research capabilities within and beyond the IIIF community, offering
      new insights into historical navigation and cartography. This proposal highlights
      the importance of this work in preserving and studying historical maps, showcasing
      the potential for advanced research methodologies in historiography and digital
      humanities.

      from Tropy, an open-source research photo management tool. Our plugin allows
      users to create, edit and export static IIIF collections through an intuitive
      user interface, with custom options for metadata schemas and annotations. Considering
      that serving IIIF assets on the web often requires extensive institutional support
      and server maintenance, we offer a straightforward alternative for small institutions
      and individuals without technical background to tile images and export their
      research materials following the IIIF specifications. The output is a file directory
      that can be hosted on GitHub Pages or other free hosting solutions, and fed
      into tools such as Canopy IIIF and Exhibit. The presentation will cover the
      project's history, use cases and feature roadmap.

  - abstract: detektIIIF is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that detects
      IIIF resources in websites. It is possible to collect IIIF manifests in a basket
      and send them to any compatible IIIF application. Version 2 of the IIIF browser
      extension detektIIIF was presented at various IIIF events in the past and has
      been installed more than 300 times. Now detektIIIF reaches version 3 and opens
      up a new field of user-friendly IIIF applications. The new version comes with
      an embedded Mirador workspace, which turns the browser extension into a versatile
      application. This makes it possible to work with IIIF manifests completely without
      copying and pasting cryptic URLs. It is also planned to connect the annotation
      function of Mirador with globally synchronized browser storage or third-party
      services and thus realize a persistent IIIF workspace that is automatically
      synchronized between different devices. The presentation explains the system
      architecture and demonstrates its use in a clear demonstration.

  - abstract: During 2022, in partnership with the UK Towards a National Collection
      project and Technical University, Delft, Digirati built a new open source IIIF
      Manifest Editor framework, that can accommodate many of the use cases for creating
      general purpose manifests, learning IIIF concepts, creating manifests for specific
      target environments and being easily integrated into diverse production workflows.<br/><br/>Now,
      in collaboration with Canadian Research Knowledge Network, Digirati are extending
      this framework to introduce a number of new features including creating collections,
      merging two manifests, creating multiple new Manifests from one very large existing
      Manifest, plus the selection, reordering and moving of canvases; and some general
      design and usability improvements.<br/><br/>In this presentation we will provide
      an overview of these features and dive into the underlying concepts and capabilities
      that facilitate them such as IIIF browsing, copy and paste, and storage.<br/><br/>

  - abstract: 'IIIF was conceived first for image interoperability. Nonetheless, recent 
      advances for integrating 3D objects, sounds and videos shifts the original image 
      framework to a multimodal framework. As researchers working with cultural heritage 
      collections, we are confronted with a wide variety of documents : texts, photographs, 
      video recordings, sketches, maps, audio, etc. Our need is not only to compare or quote 
      different images, or to annotate an image with texts. We wish also to be able to compare 
      a sketch with an extract of a video recording, to annotate a text with a sound, to navigate 
      from one document to another, be it a text, an image, or a time-based object. We wish 
      also to extract data from this document without loosing the connection with the original 
      source. IIIF may be the framework to answer such challenges which concern not only 
      research but also teaching and collections curation.<br/><br/>
      Since 2022, we have been working to bring multimodal annotation features to the 
      IIIF community using Mirador. Departing from a fork by Tokyo University (<a href="https://github.com/2SC1815J/mirador">https://github.com/2SC1815J/mirador</a>), 
      we added audio and video playback. We also created support for annotations of a Canvas 
      with another Manifest. This allowed the creation of Manifest collection navigation 
      interfaces, in the form of interactive network graphs, that we presented as a <a href="https://gitlab.tetras-libre.fr/iiif/coeso-deliverable/-/wikis/home">prototype</a>
      at the IIIF Conference 2023. <br/><br/>
      Since, we have continued development to keep up with recent Mirador updates to MUI5 
      and React17. The first prototype led to two contributions: (1) a <a href="https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador-annotations">new plugin</a> which is 
      a major refactor and update of an image annotation plugin that now supports video and audio; 
      (2) An online multi-user platform called <a href="https://gitlab.tetras-libre.fr/iiif">Arvest</a>, 
      that will be publicly available as of September 2024.<br/><br/>
      Arvest, combined with Mirador and our annotation plugin, proposes a IIIF-driven 
      environment for the creation and navigation of multimodal document networks. The users 
      can navigate collections of images, video, audio and documents through annotations of 
      different natures – from textual captions and image annotations, to annotations that are 
      linked to other Manifests. A project in Arvest is represented as a IIIF Collection of 
      Manifests, meaning that full interoperability is still insured.<br/><br/>
      We wish to render the use of IIIF accessible to a wide range of non techno-fluent users. 
      As a fully functional online multi-user environment, Arvest allows anyone with an email 
      to create an account and start creating and sharing Manifests from their media in a 
      matter of minutes.<br/><br/>
      Our current roadmap is to integrate machine learning and artificial intelligence-driven 
      workflows within the tool. In the beta version, this is achieved with an open API that 
      allows users to consult, upload and modify media, Manifests and annotations from afar. 
      The subject of future development shall look to propose curated workflows and methods 
      within the tool, streamlining complex computational workflows for a wide range of users. 
      With this API, we wish to propose Arvest as an open tool that can combine with other
      methods and projects in a fully IIIF-driven environment.'

  - abstract: This technical presentation will focus on how Archipelago, an OSS Repository
      system developed by the Metropolitan New York Library council for the past 5
      years that integrates IIIF tightly in all its concerns, allows time based Audio
      and Video, transcripts, to be converted natively into W3C compliant Annotations
      for its internal IIIF Content Search discovery (Version 1 and 2) APIs, by mutating
      back and forth temporal dimensions into spatial ones (x,y), encoding and storing
      them as discoverable OCR in MiniOCR format into a backend Solr Server. This
      approach allows us to reuse the OCR Highlight plugin developed by the Bavarian
      State Library Team which already powers textual annotations of image based resources
      and thus reuse all the supporting code that drives our ingest, pre and post
      processing workflows and discovery.<br/><br/>

  - abstract: The spectacular increase in quality and availability of Handwritten
      Text Recognition (HTR) produces large historical collections of scanned images
      with matching HTR transcriptions. At KNAW Humanities Cluster we process and
      publish several of such collections, a.o. 17th-18th century Resolutions of the
      Dutch States General (parliament) and 5 million pages from the archives of the
      Dutch East India Company. For both collections the scans are provided by the
      Dutch National Archive, using IIIF.<br/><br/>To prepare these texts for research
      we need a far more complex text model than simply treating text as a collection
      of strings associated with image regions on scans or canvases.<br/><br/>The
      paper discusses the Text Model and IIIF-inspired Text Referencing API that we
      designed, implemented and applied for a range of projects. It also covers how
      we use IIIF, the Text API and Web Annotations to publish our collections online.

  - abstract: Incorporating additional artifacts such as maps is essential to fully
      unlock the Dutch East India Company's (VOC) vast paper archives (1605-1799).
      While letters, reports, and ledgers offer historical insights, identifying the
      toponyms they mention proves challenging due to shifting place names.<br/><br/>The
      GLOBALISE project tackles this challenge by connecting the massive textual corpus
      of VOC archives with colonial maps, thereby enhancing the understanding and
      interpretation of these spatial references in the written archives. This approach
      involves three layers, each resulting in a set of web annotations that are combined
      according to the IIIF Presentation standard:<br/><br/>1. Georeferencing using
      the Allmaps tool, superimposing the early modern view of colonies onto modern
      maps.<br/><br/>2. Detecting toponyms by recognizing and transcribing labels
      from maps, and linking them to places mentioned in written archives and external
      resources.<br/><br/>3. Classifying geospatial iconography such as icons and
      symbols representing settlements, plantations, and more, advancing our understanding
      of the early modern Dutch colonial view of the world.<br/><br/>By weaving together
      text and maps, GLOBALISE allows researchers to better interpret spatial references
      in archival documents, and thus better understand (Dutch) colonial history and
      its impact on geopolitics. Publishing its enrichments via IIIF standards ensures
      open access and collaboration.<br/><br/>

  - abstract: Members from the IIIF A/V Community Group have identified use cases
      for IIIF clients that require new mechanisms in order to identify and enable
      specific functionality in IIIF viewers for annotations that contain captions,
      subtitles, audio description, transcripts and translations. Key use cases include
      distinguishing between captions/subtitles, which should be available to display
      over top of a video, and transcripts, which should be displayed in a separate
      widget for search and download. Accessibility requirements are an important
      component, and audio description tracks that contain descriptions of important
      visual information should also be made clearly available to users in IIIF viewers.
      Potentially relevant for use cases outside of A/V, content owners may also want
      to clearly distinguish between transcriptions and translations across formats,
      including newspapers and manuscripts.<br/><br/>The IIIF AV Annotations Technical
      Specification Group was formed to address these use cases and is currently discussing
      possible extensions and/or revisions for the IIIF Presentation API with the
      IIIF Editorial Board. This lightning talk aims to share the results of these
      conversations and trigger discussions in other IIIF communities that may have
      similar use cases for annotations in IIIF resources.<br/><br/>

      \ and deans, researchers, and CIOs, but, as IIIF has become more established\
      \ in the last decade, there is little literature about the management of legacy\
      \ systems as well as the need to manage people who are responsible for keeping\
      \ them afloat. In essence, this paper seeks to address that gap, presenting\
      \ a possible framework for \u2018IIIF for Managers\u2019, designed to assist\
      \ those who are responsible for their staff who are engaged in the maintenance,\

  - abstract: During this session, IIIF 3D TSG (Technical Specification Group) members 
      will provide a detailed introduction to current proposed changes to the IIIF 
      Presentation API specification that will enable robust presentation and display of 
      3D resources using IIIF concepts and tools. Practical demos will also be presented, 
      including draft examples of IIIF Presentation documents encoding 3D resources and 
      demos of viewers that support these documents to display 3D web content. Time will 
      also be given for open discussion of proposed specification drafts, practical demos. 
      The TSG is also eager to hear audience use cases that involve more advanced 3D 
      implementations, especially those involving annotation, interaction, and/or animation, 
      that are not currently supported by proposed specification drafts.

    title: IIIF and 3D workshop
    type: Birds of a Feather
  - abstract: "This session aims to offer tangible strategies and insights to increase\
      \ the uptake of IIIF by end-users. For the most part, the available tutorials\
      \ and training sessions focus on aspects (e.g., APIs or annotations) that require\
      \ technical skills. The guides and tutorials for beginners on the Consortium\u2019\
      s website or GitHub are useful, but are also advanced in a sense that it takes\
      \ a level of awareness about IIIF to visit a website dedicated to IIIF. So how\
      \ can we reach the large masses of potential IIIF end-users. How can we promote\
      \ the full potential of IIIF-compliant data? How can we create ambassadors within\
      \ our institutions, regions and sectors?<br/><br/>The session will discuss the\
      \ strategy of train-the-trainer workshops for end-users. The session will zoom\
      \ in on one workshop in particular: the workshop that was developed for the\
      \ Mmmonk project and that has been running since June 2022. It was designed\
      \ by curators and data experts to stimulate the uptake of IIIF by end-users\
      \ (i.e. create IIIF adopters), and to generate support and advocacy for IIIF\
      \ (i.e. create IIIF ambassadors). The workshop is based on three principles\
      \ to increase its effectiveness and appeal: teach only simple applications that\
      \ require no technical skills, avoid technical jargon, and use relatable and\
      \ inspiring examples and everyday scenarios. This approach puts into practice\
      \ the recommendations by the D4H WG and the insights from the 2021 UX interviews\
      \ on IIIF by Amy Deschenes et al.<br/><br/>Over the course of more than 15 workshops\
      \ reaching over 300 participants, the workshop has evolved since its inception\
      \ in 2022. We continuously integrated valuable feedback from participants, as\
      \ well as relevant technical updates and innovations. Initially, the target\
      \ audience were potential end-users in general, but in 2023 we decided to focus\
      \ on staff working at GLAMs, academic institutions and industry associations\
      \ due to the growing awareness that, even within institutions that have implemented\
      \ IIIF, most collection managers, educators, communicators, photographers, administrators\
      \ and even developers are not aware or only partially aware of what IIIF is\
      \ and what the potential is for re-use of their digital images. Because this\
      \ group could take up a key role as IIIF ambassadors, the workshop has been\
      \ adapted with scenarios and examples tailored to their specific roles, while\
      \ still avoiding any technical language or skills.<br/><br/>The session (2hrs)\
      \ will consist of a train-the-trainer workshop (circa 60 minutes), followed\
      \ by an open discussion based on insights gained from the Mmmonk workshop and\
      \ other workshops (e.g., UK Research Libraries, BnF). To kick off the discussion\
      \ and provide input for the further advancement of IIIF training and IIIF design,\
      \ we will present the results of a quantitative survey on IIIF uptake conducted\
      \ among the Mmmonk workshop participants.<br/><br/>Nastasia Vanderperren is\
      \ IIIF expert at Meemoo, a non-profit organization that supports the digital\
      \ archive operations of Flemish cultural, media and government organizations.\

  - abstract: Many of the core use cases of IIIF have been expressed not in terms
      of images and their presentation, but in terms of the digitized cultural heritage
      items. It has long been desirable to discover resources digitally available
      via IIIF by searching the properties and relationships of the real world objects,
      such as by creator, subject, classification or date. This Birds of a Feather
      session will discuss how organizations are using the Linked Art specification
      in conjunction with IIIF to obtain significant benefits through the joint adoption
      of these highly usable standards.<br/><br/>Linked Art has been designed and
      implemented over the past 5 years learning from and intentionally following
      the community best practices and design principles that IIIF has demonstrated
      to be so effective. It uses an existing, standard conceptual model and encodes
      knowledge using shared patterns in JSON-LD, made available via an easy to publish
      and consume web API. It has been adopted internationally by cultural heritage
      research and collecting institutions. We shall also discuss implementation experience
      and tools, and how to ensure the continued and rich connection between these
      overlapping communities and specifications.<br/><br/>Links:<br/><br/>* https://linked.art/<br/><br/>*

      \ The newly-formed IIIF Community Group for Education seeks more of its kind\
      \ and welcomes others to explore yet unmapped seas below the surface of IIIF\u2019\
      s global purview, for there be dragons. A weekly working group has caught the\
      \ odd fish or two, and we are casting our net more widely: for seasoned IIIF\
      \ toolmakers, collectors, and standard-bearers who\u2019d like to scale up to\
      \ a bigger market; and IIIF-ish educators, instructional designers, and academic\
      \ technologists at the farthest reaches of the GLAM sector.<br/><br/>The IIIF\
      \ Community Group for Education represents educators, educational institutions,\
      \ and cultural heritage institutions with educational functions as a group with\
      \ coherent interests to be addressed in outreach and in the development of IIIF\
      \ standards and related technologies. The group, with members from across the\
      \ community and around the world, focuses on the creative and productive uses\
      \ of IIIF resources and IIIF-enabled tools for teaching and learning. The group\
      \ seeks to address the needs of educators, potentially one of the largest and\
      \ most engaged audience for IIIF content, and recognizes the potential positive\
      \ impact of IIIF-enabled resources and tools for experiential and active learning.\
      \ Leveraging capacities of the broader IIIF community, the IIIF Community Group\
      \ works to inspire the development of new tools that reflect the needs of educators\
      \ and to serve as a focal point for knowledge-sharing among educators interested\
      \ in using IIIF as part of coursework. The group welcomes instructors, academic\
      \ technologists, and anyone else involved with the integration of IIIF tools\
      \ and resources within the context of education or educational outreach.<br/><br/>Areas\
      \ of focus include:<br/>- Familiarity with IIIF as a matter of information literacy<br/>-\
      \ Curriculum and lesson plan sharing highlighting the many ways that IIIF tools\
      \ and resources can be used as part of creative course assignments<br/>- Document\
      \ and develop IIIF-based instructional tools for teaching and learning, such\
      \ as tools for the creation of \u201Cteaching collections\u201D, additional\
      \ tools for annotation and writing, and tools for digital exhibit creation.<br/>-\
      \ Identifying gaps and institutional needs, including IT infrastructure, instructional\
      \ and academic technology support, in a wide spectrum of institution types.<br/><br/>This\
      \ \u201Cfish-of-a-school\u201D session will provide an overview of the group's\
      \ current work, goals for the future, and serve as a space of networking for\
      \ educators and education-related professionals, as well as a session of brainstorming\
      \ to determine the immediate needs of educators. Participation in this session\
      \ or in the related Community Group does not presuppose any technical skills\

  - abstract: IIIF has allowed annotation of images for years, but with the addition
      of audio-visual support with version 3.0, a world of new possibilities opens
      up. However, A/V annotations go well beyond a textual body targeting a region
      of a painting -- established usages such as captioning, subtitling, and speaker
      diarization come into contact with scholarly annotation for film studies or
      oral history. In addition, the WebAnnotation technical specification must interoperate
      with established standards like WebVTT or OHMS.<br/><br/>This meeting will discuss
      the range of annotation practices for A/V and connect practitioners as they
      navigate implementing them in IIIF.
