  - abstract: To complement the growing impact of IIIF in 2D and Audio/Video (A/V)
      collections around the world, the 3D Technical Specification Group (TSG) is
      meeting frequently to advance a draft of standards for 3D content, to complement
      and expand the potential of all IIIF-based collections. In addition, the 3D
      Community Group (CG) shares significant projects, tools and contacts with other
      3D researchers and developer communities to collaboratively consider challenges
      and potential solutions in common. The two IIIF 3D groups work together engaging
      with specialists and representatives across user communities, international
      and standards bodies, as outlined in their charters. The combined CG and TSG
      efforts are working to extend IIIF suitably into the 3rd dimension, expanding
      options for better data sharing across institutions and collections, to help
      overcome barriers for sustainable sharing. The TSG is determining workable options
      for incorporation of 2D and A/V with 3D data, including to enable digital dioramas
      (mini-metaverses), with considerations for scene and soundscape constructions,
      and the potential to help build a more inclusive and sustainable metaverse.
      This session will provide an update on the work and progress with use cases
      and technical specification drafting for the evolution of IIIF 3D. Please do

  - abstract: Formerly known as the IIIF React Media Player, Ramp (https://github.com/samvera-labs/ramp/)
      is a IIIF viewer for audiovisual materials that supports the IIIF Presentation
      3.0 API. It is an exportable NPM component library that provides ReactJS components
      for media playback, structures (table of contents) display, transcript presentation,
      metadata display, supplemental files, and highlighting annotations. A benefit
      of a component-based IIIF viewer is that individual implementations can choose
      which components to utilize and how to integrate them into their application.
      Ramp is now the primary media player for the Avalon Media System, providing
      nearly all item display functionality in Avalon.<br/><br/>In order to help community
      members with audiovisual media determine if Ramp would be useful for their needs,
      it has been added to the IIIF Viewer Matrix and has an up-to-date live demo
      site (https://ramp.avalonmediasystem.org/).<br/><br/>This presentation will
      provide an overview of Ramp and its constituent components and demonstrate how
      they are leveraged in the Avalon Media System. It will also provide an update
      on future work to broaden support for annotations and increase interoperability
      with AVAnnotate and Aviary, other producers of IIIF Presentation 3.0 manifests
      for audiovisual media.<br/><br/>

  - abstract: "Existing interfaces presenting digitized map series leave much to be\
      \ desired. Navigation can be cumbersome and georeferenced versions break the\
      \ link to the original image. The combination of IIIF\u2019s Georeference Extension,\
      \ the open source ecosystem Allmaps, and a group of ambitious students has yielded\
      \ new methods for georeferencing map series and presenting them to a wider audience.\
      \ This was achieved by transcribing historical sources about the series, converting\
      \ geographic coordinates, using computer vision to detect the corners of the\
      \ map depicted on the image, and publishing the results as Georeference Annotations.<br/><br/>By\
      \ applying the methods to other map series in IIIF-compatible repositories,\
      \ their reusability is demonstrated. New features such as thin plate spline\
      \ transformation, distortion analysis to assess the accuracy of maps, and alternative\
      \ map projections will pass in review, as well as suggestions for how to publish\
      \ reusable information about map series as linked open data.<br/><br/>Last but\
      \ not least, Allmaps Arcade is introduced, a playful interface to encourage\
      \ public engagement with digitized map collections that can be configured with\
      \ a specific map series and geographic area. Players are asked to place sheets\
      \ in the right position and earn points based on speed and accuracy."

  - abstract: 'The IIIF for Education Community Group is bringing together educators,
      academic technologists, librarians, instructional designers, museum professionals,
      and others to examine the ways IIIF resources and IIIF-related tools can be
      used as part of curriculum in Learning Management System (LMSs) and other online
      platforms to create meaningful, constructive, and collective learning experiences
      for students. Our development and implementation of course assignments making
      use of existing IIIF-enabled tools and resources has led us to consider them
      in light of three key aspects: teaching/pedagogy, assignment design, and campus
      infrastructure. In doing so, we hope to highlight best practices for teaching
      with IIIF tools and resources but also to identify current gaps in support for
      educators and to guide the development of new and existing tools. This lightning
      talk will highlight the tools that help to make these valuable experiences possible
      while also touching on potential areas for future development or adaptation
      to allow these tools and resources to play a more central role in teaching and

  - abstract: There is a growing interest within cultural heritage organisations to
      understand the environmental impact of the infrastructure used to power the
      digital services accessed by the public. However, understanding the complexity
      behind this challenge involves breaking down the problem into well-defined and
      easily understood use cases that are common across the sector. At this point,
      we can begin to define the benchmarks, tools and techniques that help to generate
      data we require to start more informed discussions. The application of IIIF
      generates interesting use cases, such as the challenge of handling the large
      amounts of annotation data that result from the OCR of images at scale. In this
      talk, we will describe ongoing work to help understand this challenge and examine
      how the choice of technology can impact the digital footprint of a IIIF-related
      digital service. More specifically we will examine the performance of the annotation
      server Miiify [1] against some repeatable benchmarks when applied to real-world
      data at scale. The goal is to share our findings and hopefully generate further
      discussion and sharing of best practices within the field of green computing.<br/><br/>[1]

  - abstract: This proposal outlines the development of tools to support the comparison
      of historical maps using IIIF, initiated by the Historiographical Institute,
      the University of Tokyo. This project focuses on the integration and comparative
      analysis of Japan's national pictorial maps and other significant maritime maps
      from the 15th century onwards. By leveraging IIIF, the proposed tools aim to
      facilitate a deeper understanding of historical maritime routes and geographical
      knowledge. We have developed Mirador plugins that use annotations to structure
      information on place names and maritime routes within the maps, supporting the
      comparative analysis of common elements across multiple maps. Furthermore, we
      have constructed visualization tools compliant with the IIIF Georeference Extension,
      enabling researchers to compare historical maps with modern geographical data
      without distortion. By emphasizing open-source accessibility, these tools promise
      to enhance research capabilities within and beyond the IIIF community, offering
      new insights into historical navigation and cartography. This proposal highlights
      the importance of this work in preserving and studying historical maps, showcasing
      the potential for advanced research methodologies in historiography and digital
      humanities.

  - abstract: In this talk we introduce Tropiiify, a plugin for exporting IIIF collections
      from Tropy, an open-source research photo management tool. Our plugin allows
      users to create, edit and export static IIIF collections through an intuitive
      user interface, with custom options for metadata schemas and annotations. Considering
      that serving IIIF assets on the web often requires extensive institutional support
      and server maintenance, we offer a straightforward alternative for small institutions
      and individuals without technical background to tile images and export their
      research materials following the IIIF specifications. The output is a file directory
      that can be hosted on GitHub Pages or other free hosting solutions, and fed
      into tools such as Canopy IIIF and Exhibit. The presentation will cover the
      project's history, use cases and feature roadmap.

  - abstract: "This session aims to offer tangible strategies and insights to increase\
      \ the uptake of IIIF by end-users. For the most part, the available tutorials\
      \ and training sessions focus on aspects (e.g., APIs or annotations) that require\
      \ technical skills. The guides and tutorials for beginners on the Consortium\u2019\
      s website or GitHub are useful, but are also advanced in a sense that it takes\
      \ a level of awareness about IIIF to visit a website dedicated to IIIF. So how\
      \ can we reach the large masses of potential IIIF end-users. How can we promote\
      \ the full potential of IIIF-compliant data? How can we create ambassadors within\
      \ our institutions, regions and sectors?<br/><br/>The session will discuss the\
      \ strategy of train-the-trainer workshops for end-users. The session will zoom\
      \ in on one workshop in particular: the workshop that was developed for the\
      \ Mmmonk project and that has been running since June 2022. It was designed\
      \ by curators and data experts to stimulate the uptake of IIIF by end-users\
      \ (i.e. create IIIF adopters), and to generate support and advocacy for IIIF\
      \ (i.e. create IIIF ambassadors). The workshop is based on three principles\
      \ to increase its effectiveness and appeal: teach only simple applications that\
      \ require no technical skills, avoid technical jargon, and use relatable and\
      \ inspiring examples and everyday scenarios. This approach puts into practice\
      \ the recommendations by the D4H WG and the insights from the 2021 UX interviews\
      \ on IIIF by Amy Deschenes et al.<br/><br/>Over the course of more than 15 workshops\
      \ reaching over 300 participants, the workshop has evolved since its inception\
      \ in 2022. We continuously integrated valuable feedback from participants, as\
      \ well as relevant technical updates and innovations. Initially, the target\
      \ audience were potential end-users in general, but in 2023 we decided to focus\
      \ on staff working at GLAMs, academic institutions and industry associations\
      \ due to the growing awareness that, even within institutions that have implemented\
      \ IIIF, most collection managers, educators, communicators, photographers, administrators\
      \ and even developers are not aware or only partially aware of what IIIF is\
      \ and what the potential is for re-use of their digital images. Because this\
      \ group could take up a key role as IIIF ambassadors, the workshop has been\
      \ adapted with scenarios and examples tailored to their specific roles, while\
      \ still avoiding any technical language or skills.<br/><br/>The session (2hrs)\
      \ will consist of a train-the-trainer workshop (circa 60 minutes), followed\
      \ by an open discussion based on insights gained from the Mmmonk workshop and\
      \ other workshops (e.g., UK Research Libraries, BnF). To kick off the discussion\
      \ and provide input for the further advancement of IIIF training and IIIF design,\
      \ we will present the results of a quantitative survey on IIIF uptake conducted\
      \ among the Mmmonk workshop participants.<br/><br/>Nastasia Vanderperren is\
      \ IIIF expert at Meemoo, a non-profit organization that supports the digital\
      \ archive operations of Flemish cultural, media and government organizations.\
      \ Evelien Hauwaerts is medieval manuscripts curator at Bruges Public Library.\
      \ They are both core members of the IIIF Network Association Flanders & Netherlands."

  - abstract: During 2022, in partnership with the UK Towards a National Collection
      project and Technical University, Delft, Digirati built a new open source IIIF
      Manifest Editor framework, that can accommodate many of the use cases for creating
      general purpose manifests, learning IIIF concepts, creating manifests for specific
      target environments and being easily integrated into diverse production workflows.<br/><br/>Now,
      in collaboration with Canadian Research Knowledge Network, Digirati are extending
      this framework to introduce a number of new features including creating collections,
      merging two manifests, creating multiple new Manifests from one very large existing
      Manifest, plus the selection, reordering and moving of canvases; and some general
      design and usability improvements.<br/><br/>In this presentation we will provide
      an overview of these features and dive into the underlying concepts and capabilities
      that facilitate them such as IIIF browsing, copy and paste, and storage.<br/><br/>
