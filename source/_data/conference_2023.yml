  - abstract: The National Library of Wales was an early adopter of IIIF for content
      delivery and of Linked Open Data for enriching its metadata and ease of access.
      With metadata for thousands of images freely available on Wikidata we began
      exploring the use of IIIF to tag depicted entities within our collection, initially
      on Wikidata and later by utilizing Wikidata entities on our IIIF-driven crowdsourcing
      platform. With tens of thousands of tags added we can start to explore the use
      cases for this data and the added value for research and discovery. With the
      help of a student, placement has also undertaken a review of our methodology
      in order to assess the accuracy of this tagging and to explore some of the challenges
      of using large open vocabularies. Whist most of our work has focused on visual
      content, we are also considering how IIIF annotations and linked data can be
      used to enrich digital texts, and to connect texts with other related digital
      content. This talk will present our work and our lessons learned using practical
      examples, visualisations and statistical analysis It will also touch on the
      latest developments and our future plans to further integrate linked open data
      into our IIIF manifests and to think about new ways of utilizing IIIF to improve
      user experience, including the development of our own Wikibase instance with
      a controlled set of linked entities.

    title: IIIF is LOUD - Combining Linked Open Data and IIIF and The National Library
      of Wales
    type: Presentation
  - abstract: "In this presentation, Giovanni Borelli, CTO of Haltadefinizione, will\
      \ illustrate the potential of Coosmo in the management and preservation of IIIF\
      \ resources. He will delineate, for a technical audience, why Coosmo is one\
      \ of the best solutions to easily store and share a huge number of images, even\
      \ very big ones.<br/><br/>The need to share cultural heritage on a global scale\
      \ has become more urgent in recent years. This urgency is accompanied by the\
      \ need to guarantee the high-quality preservation of heritage materials to make\
      \ digital archives a valuable asset for the institution that houses them. The\
      \ rapid growth of Digital Humanities and the consequent demand for efficient\
      \ digital content repositories have accelerated the spread of IIIF on a large\
      \ scale. A state-of-the-art digital archive is essential to enhance the cultural\
      \ heritage and the institutions that preserve it.<br/><br/>Coosmo is a Digital\
      \ Asset Management service, compatible with IIIF Image and Presentation API,\
      \ specifically designed to manage large quantities of digital assets even in\
      \ ultra-high resolution. It is flexible and adaptable to different scenarios,\
      \ such as the preservation and enhancement of cultural heritage and open data.\
      \ The leading advantages of Coosmo rest in the total number of images managed\
      \ to date and in the fact that most of these images are very large-resolution\
      \ images. To give a few examples, today Coosmo hosts a total of about 18 million\
      \ images, some large hundreds of Gigabytes each. In addition, within the storage\
      \ of Coosmo, we find hundreds of pyramid images larger than 500 megabytes and\
      \ more than a thousand Master files greater than one Gigabyte.<br/><br/>Coosmo\
      \ is a Software As A Service solution, ready-to-use turnkey without additional\
      \ costs, and requires no external storage space. From a functional point of\
      \ view, Coosmo allows you to search in your archive either through a graphical\
      \ web interface or via REST web API. It allows the integration of IIIF viewer\
      \ software within third-party sites (for example institutional sites) and it\
      \ offers users the possibility to create animations and dynamic stories for\
      \ cultural enhancement based on managed assets. Thanks to Coosmo\u2019s compatibility\
      \ with IIIF protocols, users can benefit from greater interoperability with\
      \ existing systems within libraries, archives, or museums that adhere to these\
      \ standards.<br/><br/>Coosmo can do all this while maintaining excellent performance\
      \ and a first-class user experience: it can scale dynamically based on a load\
      \ of users who require access to images.<br/><br/>Finally, data security is\
      \ a top priority for Coosmo. All data is securely hosted in the cloud using\
      \ best practices for encryption and authentication. The software offers a safe\
      \ and effective way to keep track of digital media thanks to visible and invisible\
      \ watermarks with an authentication system.<br/><br/>Presenting Coosmo at the\
      \ IIIF 2023 Annual Conference is an opportunity to display an example of software\
      \ that can easily make accessible and usable IIIF resources that require considerable\
      \ memory space. For all these reasons, Coosmo could become one of the key elements\
      \ employed by the IIIF Community.<br/><br/>"

  - abstract: MLOL is the main network of digital libraries in Italy, comprising 6,500
      state and public libraries and 1,500 school libraries, and serving over 1.5
      million registered users. Since 2019, the MLOL platform has employed an IIIF
      infrastructure that offers a variety of services, including the publication
      of digitized collections from libraries, archives, and museums, the creation
      of narrative mash-ups and annotations for registered users, and the discovery
      of IIIF resources from Italian and foreign cultural institutions, with over
      2 million indexed items as of the beginning of 2023.<br/><br/>In this presentation,
      I will focus on a new tool that was released on MLOL in early 2023. This tool
      combines the creation of narrative mash-ups and annotations with all the IIIF
      objects that registered users can find in our repository, with an emphasis on
      its usability and the potential for widespread dissemination among library users,
      teachers, and students who use school libraries.<br/><br/>As a case study, I
      will reference the Emilia Romagna region, where, on the initiative of the regional
      administration and the Regional School Office, all schools (elementary and secondary)
      have a library that adheres to the MLOL platform, and have conducted educational
      activities using the IIIF-based tools on the MLOL platform.

  - abstract: "The challenge of creating highly-structured and heterogeneous content,\
      \ while integrating it into well-established technologies, resources, and workflows\
      \ involving LOD, IIIF, TEI, etc. is getting more and more relevant as these\
      \ technologies become popular, increasing their expressivity and complexity.\
      \ A strategy for addressing these issues is introducing new layers of abstractions\
      \ to fill the gap, moving the task of generating output IT artifacts from users\
      \ to software. This approach provides the added benefit of higher abstraction\
      \ level in modeling, and of multiple output types, eventually changing in time\
      \ and/or purposes. On such a basis, a fundamental requirement is having reusable\
      \ software solutions. The panel highlights: (I) the functionalities of CADMUS,\
      \ an open-access framework for content creation, as well as its export into\
      \ IIIF; (II) a specific use case for it, consisting of a model built in the\
      \ domain of medieval manuscript description; (III) further enhancements of the\
      \ model by the NAPLES DANTE PROJECT.<br/><br/>Cadmus is used to connect a wealth\
      \ of highly specialized data with a number of different, automatically generated\
      \ output, ranging from rich IIIF resources to standoff TEI documents with multiple\
      \ layers of annotations. It is an open-ended, modular, and full-stack creation\
      \ system for highly structured content, including text with any number of specialized\
      \ annotation layers, capable of multiple types of data export and import. Key\
      \ concepts here are reuse and integration, attained via a modular design, both\
      \ in data and in software, so that models are dynamically built by aggregation,\
      \ like its editor. This also fosters collaborative design and tools in the scholars\
      \ community, often developing models which start from the bottom and get progressively\
      \ refined, towards a higher level of sharing and abstraction.<br/><br/>CODICOLOGY\
      \ is a set of Cadmus modules focused on codicology and palaeography. It originated\
      \ from Petrarch's ITINERA project, but has been designed to be suitable for\
      \ other projects involving medieval manuscript descriptions. The talk explains\
      \ how structuring a model for describing medieval manuscripts balances practical\
      \ needs, traditional descriptive standards, and high-level architecture, to\
      \ provide granular, computable data on manuscript elements, such as quires,\
      \ bindings, palaeography, decoration, content, historical aspects, etc. Eventually,\
      \ it shows how Codicology can be integrated with other parts of Cadmus or Cadmus\
      \ tools such as IIIF annotations, to enhance the model\u2019s capabilities.<br/><br/>University\
      \ of Naples is working on the enhancement of some parts of CODICOLOGY, starting\
      \ from the Illuminated Dante Project\u2019s \u2018decoration\u2019 section (already\
      \ an improvement of the XML TEI-P5 <decoDesc> element), in order to make the\
      \ model suitable for describing decorative and illustrative contents in different\
      \ book formats (medieval manuscripts, printed books, in-series drawings). Beside\
      \ art-historical and stylistic features, the new model will introduce specific\
      \ iconographic features (themes, subjects, keywords), implement standard LOD\
      \ lexicons such as Iconclass, and set the text-image relationship with a granularity\
      \ ranging from the text\u2019s main structures to the smallest textual units\
      \ such as poetry verses or prose paragraphs. The exportability of the model\
      \ through IIIF manifests will allow integrating data with greater ease in IIIF-compliant\
      \ illustrated-manuscript or book collections."

  - abstract: 'In the context of my PhD in Digital Humanities at the University of
      Basel (2021-2025), I investigate the semantics and interoperability dimensions
      of standards that adhere to the Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) design principles
      [1], such as the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) specifications
      and more specifically the IIIF Presentation API 3.0, Linked Art and the Web
      Annotation Data Model [2].<br/><br/>This presentation is an opportunity to delve
      into one of my research questions which is related to the practices of IIIF
      and Linked Art by drawing attention to the social fabrics that constitute these
      communities notably from the standpoint of the Actor-Network Theory (ANT), a
      constructivist approach widely spread in Science and Technology Studies (STS)
      which should help me to better comprehend the roles and relationships of all
      actors in the implementation of LOUD standards within the cultural heritage
      domain and more broadly across the Digital Humanities.<br/><br/>While the presentation,
      structured around two parts, is aimed at a general audience and accessible to
      all, more technical aspects are also discussed, for example to illustrate how
      IIIF APIs are developed and maintained.<br/><br/>Firstly, I intend to identify
      the sociotechnical requirements for the establishment of community-driven initiatives,
      looking in particular at associations that are constituted around consensus-building
      and advocacy efforts. There are many good cases here, from the creation of community
      and technical specification groups, the relationship between the consortium
      and the community, the extent to which transparency plays a vital role, but
      also the relevance and impact of nonhuman actors such as data models, APIs,
      validators, as well as collaboratively developed software. This first part will
      also provide a means of testing the hypothesis that community-driven specifications,
      if they require significant commitment from all sides and are developed slowly,
      tend to be successful in the medium to long term.<br/><br/>Secondly, I will
      explore how the implementation of IIIF has progressed within cultural heritage
      institutions and the potential of the framework in relation to scientific movements
      and principles, such as Open Science, Citizen Science, FAIR [3] as well as CARE
      [4]. I will give an overview of the various surveys conducted within the IIIF
      community in recent years and present the results of my own investigation determining
      where IIIF stands both conceptually and technically. This second part offers
      a chance to report on the four key initiatives (Advocacy & Leadership, Technical
      Development, Community Development, Membership & Value) of the strategic framework
      presented at the IIIF online event held in December 2022 [5].<br/><br/>More
      generally, this will be a platform to revisit and discuss over ten years of
      IIIF practice, the intersection with Linked Art for semantically conveying knowledge
      in an event-based manner and for metadata aggregation, and the Web Annotation
      Data Model for driving multi-layered assertions from observations to rich narratives,
      and to consider how LOUD situates itself in relation to communities maintaining
      such specifications.<br/><br/>[1] https://phd.julsraemy.ch<br/><br/>[2] https://linked.art/loud<br/><br/>[3]

    title: The LOUD Social Fabrics of IIIF
    type: Presentation
  - abstract: "The Swiss Federal Archives (SFA) are part of the administration of\
      \ the federal state of Switzerland. They are responsible for the archiving of\
      \ the business files of the federal authorities, in particular the government,\
      \ the parliament and the civil service. The access to and the consultation of\
      \ records by researchers and the public is a cornerstone of their legal mandate.\
      \ In order to meet the current and future access requirements the SFA pursue\
      \ a strategy of consequent digital transformation that aims at easing access\
      \ to archival information for users.<br/><br/>Currently, the SFA use IIIF for\
      \ the website Minutes of the Federal Council (1848-1963), which presents handwritten\
      \ documents together with AI-powered text recognition. In February 2023, IIIF\
      \ will also be implemented in the general Online access to the Federal Archives.<br/><br/>The\
      \ SFA began to consider IIIF as an interesting option to provide access to the\
      \ digital and digitized documents in their repositories in 2018. However, while\
      \ there were many interesting examples of museums, galleries and libraries on\
      \ the internet, specific archival use of IIIF was lacking. Considering risks\
      \ and budgets, the SFA decided to start the journey with IIIF by small steps.<br/><br/>The\
      \ proposed paper will provide a use case of implementation of IIIF in a governmental\
      \ and administrative context. It will demonstrate the step by step approach\
      \ taken and discuss the experiences made from the first limited pilot of generating\
      \ and publishing files, using a working front- and backend infrastructure to\
      \ the integration of IIIF into the general Online access.<br/><br/>On the one\
      \ hand, the presentation will discuss the various challenges faced on the way.\
      \ It will pay particular attention to aspects specific to the state and administrative\
      \ context like the legal framework, administrative business processes, archival\
      \ standards and the growing online demand for archival material by a multilingual\
      \ clientele. Within this setting, the presentation will consider the current\
      \ and future potential of IIIF in general and of Archival IIIF in particular\
      \ (in which the SFA collaborated with the Swiss Social Archives).<br/><br/>On\
      \ the other hand, the presentation will also assess the practical effects of\
      \ IIIF for the SFA\u2019s access processes and the user behaviour. What does\
      \ it mean to enable easy and direct access to documents for researchers deploying\
      \ IIIF technology? Issues to be discuss here are above all the interoperability\
      \ with the existing IT infrastructure, the mass digitization of paper repositories,\
      \ the various types of digital archival material and the interoperability within\
      \ the OAIS framework.<br/><br/>The presentation will conclude with an outline\
      \ of further development perspectives for IIIF within the SFA\u2019s access\
      \ setting and of future opportunities of collaboration with partners. "

    title: The implementation of IIIF at the Swiss Federal Archives
    type: Presentation
  - abstract: 'The DB SERET Company has been an associate member of the IIIF consortium
      since 2020. The Company has adopted IIIF technology in its services and products,
      providing for LAM-institutions (Libraries, Archives, Museums). The main focus
      in its mission is to support digital humanities and bring an active contribution
      to the preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage.<br/><br/>This talk
      aims to showcase two different IIIF implementation experiences in cross-domain
      environments, including a variety of digital assets. Firstly, it will focus
      on the activities preformed for the Region of Sardinia, which has a rich digital
      collection, very divergent in typologies and provenances (archaeological, museum,
      archival and library holdings). In this use case, a IIIF-compliant DAM has been
      implemented. The IIIF pipeline is able to process the URIs and JSON-LD information
      in order to expose the image collections, with the integration of Mirador and
      Universal Viewer. It will be highlighted how the server is able to offer maximum
      effectiveness in terms of use and quality of the original images that are ingested
      into the DAM. The main interest is to demonstrate how this implementation will
      disseminate this local culture (which ranges from the material manifestations
      of Neolithic sites to contemporary works), rich in tradition and relevance for
      the cultural history of humankind expressed in its great variety of resources,
      for the benefit of the international community of scholars.<br/><br/>Another
      cross-domain approach using IIIF, very different from the previous one, is the
      platform implemented in the European Space Agency. Starting from the digitisation
      project of the ESA Archives, DB SERET has provided a platform capable of gathering
      annotations using Mirador. The platform has been launched last January 2023:
      json manifests and annotations of the photographic collection are now available,
      and the publication of additional resources is imminent.<br/><br/>In a sense,
      it is a work in progress aimed at studying a future intermediate archive, which
      will be able to preserve the documentary heritage of the Agency. In a nutshell,
      a great variety of assets can be accessed using the IIIF protocol. A challenging
      aspect in this scenario is the aggregation of archival materials in a hybrid
      context, associating other digital assets in the same discovery tool to be explored
      through the IIIF viewers.<br/><br/>The two different experiences will illustrate
      the use of two different tools: Fontus for the digital resources of the Region
      of Sardinia and Omnes for ESA, powered by DB SERET. As mentioned earlier, both
      software integrate IIIF compliant and open source components.<br/><br/>Finally,
      the talk will illustrate a common issue, in the two separate implementations,
      which is handling of hybrid metadata associated with different digital resources,
      and the crosswalk needed for the IIIF Presentation API Metadata section.<br/><br/>'

  - abstract: "In active development since 2015, MemoRekall is a free and open source\
      \ web app for the documentation and preservation of time-based media.\
      \ The app is an interface that allows for the redocumenarisation of\
      \ a primary video resource: the user provides a Youtube or Vimeo video\
      \ to which they can append intra- and inter-documentary, multi-modal annotations\
      \ (links, files, other MemoRekall projects etc.). The arrangement of\
      \ these documents creates a capsule which can be shared and embedded.\
      \ MemoRekall is a powerful yet simple tool that is already used by\
      \ a wide range of users: researchers, artists, cultural institutions and mediators,\
      \ teachers and students. MemoRekall is currently in a new phase of\
      \ development with the primary goal of rendering it compatible with\
      \ IIIF. This new version is developed as plugins and patches for the widely-used\
      \ Mirador viewer and takes full advantage of the latest developments of IIIF\u2019\
      s Presentation API. Our source code is available at https://gitlab.tetras-libre.fr/iiif/\
      \ and builds upon a previous Mirador fork supporting video from Tokyo\
      \ University (https://github.com/2SC1815J/mirador), as well as an annotation\
      \ plugin for images that we extended to support video (https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador-annotations).\
      \ Our contributions include the update of those projects and their\
      \ extension to support the annotation of a manifest with another manifest.<br/><br/>We\
      \ propose:<br/>- A fully functional video player and annotator within Mirador\
      \ built upon existing work mentioned above.<br/>- The creation of manifest\
      \ networks: each annotation can refer to another manifest, allowing\
      \ the creation of complex networks of multi-modal content. Leaning on IIIF\u2019\
      s interoperability capabilities, this also means that networks can\
      \ be constituted from a number of different sources.<br/>- Dynamic\
      \ network navigation in Mirador: annotations linked to other manifests can be opened\
      \ directly in the same instance of Mirador, allowing for a seamless navigation experience.<br/><br/>We\
      \ also aim to ensure full retrocompatibility with existing MemoRekall projects\
      \ in order to support our current user-base and encourage a dialogue\
      \ between them and the IIIF community.<br/><br/>This work has been\
      \ driven by a concrete case study in the context of the Horizon 2020 COESO\
      \ project. A pilot manifest network was constructed around this project and\
      \ served as the basis for our working prototype. It has allowed us\
      \ to follow a practice-led design approach, and has brought to light\
      \ a number of issues that will be important going forth. Notably, we\
      \ intend to adopt a git-inspired version control model, allowing for different versions\
      \ of manifest networks and cumulative and comparative work between different researchers.\
      \ This addresses a fundamental issue in SHS analysis where each researcher can\
      \ propose radically different ideas on the same set of resources. Leaning on\
      \ IIIF, MemoRekall wishes to propose an environment where these perspectives\
      \ co-exist in a dynamic and intelligible way. This will also pave the\
      \ way for the integration of AI- and ML-driven corpus analysis tools which shall\
      \ be the subject of our next phase of development."

  - abstract: 'JPEG2000 is one of the key image formats used with IIIF. It has the
      advantage of allowing quick access to regions and sizes and is supported by
      most IIIF Image Servers. JPEG2000 (jp2) is a flexible format which can be generated
      through a number of different parameters or recipes and this presentation will
      look at the impact of passing these to an encoder and show which results in
      the most performant image for IIIF. Similar parameter choices can be replicated
      in many of the different encoders including open source and commercial. The
      IIIF community has been working with Kakadu to evaluate a new extension to the
      JPEG2000 standards called High Throughput JPEG 2000 (htj2k). The latest results
      of this work testing different parameters will be presented and their effects
      on htj2k images and JPEG2000 Part 1 images. '

    title: Creating the best JPEG2000s for IIIF
    type: Presentation
  - abstract: 'Historical newspapers and journals are an important source of information
      for researchers studying the past. However, searching for specific people within
      these newspapers and journals can be a difficult task due to the large volume
      of articles and the lack of structured data. Traditional search methods, such
      as keyword search, are often not sufficient for finding information about specific
      individuals, especially when the information is spread across multiple articles.<br/><br/>The
      proposed paper will cover the process and results of a research project to create
      an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow which allows annotating
      of names, training of a machine learning model and inference of a corpus of
      historical data in order to disambiguate names found within a International
      Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) document by linking each name to an
      entity within a knowledge base (Wikidata), through Named Entity Recognition
      (NER) and Named Entity Linking (NEL).<br/><br/>The workflow, which was able
      to identify over 226 million names, allows researchers to query a database for
      a specific person or group of people based on a linked-data query, which will
      generate a collection level IIIF manifest of all articles within the National
      Library of Wales online Newspaper and Journals which mention that person. The
      paper will also demonstrate how additional IIIF content can be linked through
      Linked open data.<br/><br/>This process allows researchers to easily collate
      articles that mentions a person or group of people and have the articles be
      viewable within a single interface (Universal Viewer or Mirador) and to annotate
      those articles.<br/><br/>The paper will discuss the process of collecting and
      annotating data, training a machine learning model and limitations of named
      entity linking. While exploring other research possibilities such as identifying
      new people and creating new Wikidata articles for those people.<br/><br/>Keywords:

    title: Utilising IIIF and Knowledge Bases for Searching for People within Historical
      Newspaper and Journal Articles
    type: Presentation
  - abstract: "Since late 2022, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) has been collaborating\
      \ with the Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO) to implement Archipelago,\
      \ a flexible, extensible, and deeply IIIF-integrated open source digital objects\
      \ repository software. IIIF APIs and IIIF compliant viewer customizations, including\
      \ IIIF tile source and W3C Web Annotations, are woven into the system\u2019\
      s architecture and functionality. Smaller shops and teams, regardless of parent\
      \ institution capacity, require strategic consideration when selecting materials\
      \ to digitize and exhibit in digital spaces. Library, archive and museums, independent\
      \ of their size, budget, and mission, need to manage intersecting pragmatic\
      \ and postulatory concerns regarding sustainability, not only in terms of efforts\
      \ but also the underlying technologies they utilize. The successful, collaborative\
      \ implementation of Archipelago in RPI\u2019s repository and archives infrastructure\
      \ has led to explorations and practicable applications of using IIIF-enabled\
      \ exhibition and research capabilities to showcase collections in ways previously\
      \ not possible, with alacrity and confidence in the longer term open accessibility\
      \ of valuable resources.<br/><br/>RPI and METRO have combined their expertise\
      \ to focus on a use case which highlights a civil engineer traveling and conducting\
      \ field surveys throughout Peru in the 1860s. Through travelogs, correspondence\
      \ and detailed journals this project maps and tracks the engineers movements\
      \ and activities over a 4 year period of time. The importance of this project\
      \ is immeasurable and can create historical ties between RPI\u2019s early civil\
      \ engineers who were intrepid travelers from North and South America and among\
      \ the first engineers to work in and call home different regions of both continents.\
      \ At present archivists and researchers are afforded only a small window into\
      \ the world of engineering of the 19th century because the narratives and details\
      \ of field work remain sparse, disparate and siloed. Empowering discovery and\
      \ (re)use tools like the IIIF Presentation API and rich IIIF Viewers like Mirador\
      \ let us emblazon these records into freely accessible digital spaces, wherein\
      \ researchers can gain glimpses into the global exchange of practices, travels,\
      \ and ideas that moved through the world and field of engineering.<br/><br/>During\
      \ this presentation, participants will learn about the different ways the RPI\
      \ and METRO teams incorporate Archipelago\u2019s IIIF dynamic manifest generation,\
      \ W3C Web Annotations, discovery, custom REST APIs and GeoJSON templates referencing\
      \ IIIF\u2019s navPlace Extension and extensive LoD to curate and craft a rich\
      \ digital presentation of RPI\u2019s 19th century engineering travel journals.\
      \ Presenters will explain how the extensibility of IIIF and the many UI facing\
      \ tools Archipelago provides, affords archivists the ability to restore a collection's\
      \ lost contextualities and allows researchers innovative methods that can open\
      \ doors to new ones. This presentation will highlight the different ways IIIF\
      \ standards and implementations empower researchers to uncover and traverse\
      \ new and established historical narratives, and is intended for both general\
      \ and technical audiences."

    type: Lightning talk
  - abstract: The proposed lightning talk will showcase the capabilities of the VIKUS
      Viewer and its associated VIKUS IIIF Generator, as a web-based visualization
      system that enables the exploration of large cultural artifact collections.
      Relevant to the IIIF community, it demonstrates a practical application of IIIF
      standards in the form of a VIKUS Viewer that can be used to view entire IIIF
      Collections (Presentation 3.x API) using the IIIF Image API in a user-friendly
      and interactive way.<br/><br/>The presentation will begin by introducing the
      VIKUS Viewer and its unique capabilities, specifically, how it arranges thousands
      of cultural artifacts on a dynamic canvas and supports the exploration of thematic
      and temporal patterns of large collections, while providing rapid access to
      high-resolution imagery.<br/><br/>Next, the VIKUS IIIF Generator will be introduced,
      which can be used to view entire IIIF Collections (Presentation 3.x API) with
      the VIKUS Viewer. The Docker instance's ability to crawl all manifests in a
      IIIF Collection recursively, download images of each canvas using the IIIF Image
      API, create spritesheets, extract metadata, and generate image similarity layouts
      using dimension reduction techniques like UMAP will be demonstrated.<br/><br/>We
      will show real-world examples of IIIF Collections visualized using the VIKUS
      IIIF Generator to demonstrate the project's practical usage. Additionally, the
      REST API and websocket for real-time progress updates and the ability to download
      data ZIP archive for VIKUS Viewer will be discussed.<br/><br/>This presentation
      is directed towards both technical and general audiences. Technical audiences
      can gain a deeper understanding of the IIIF standards and how they can be implemented
      in a practical application, while general audiences can learn about the capabilities
      of IIIF and how it can be used to view and explore digital collections in a
      visually engaging way.<br/><br/>Overall, the presentation aims to showcase the
      capabilities of the VIKUS Viewer and its associated VIKUS IIIF Generator, as
      a powerful tool for exploring large cultural artifact collections. It also aims
      to contribute to the IIIF community by providing a practical application of
      IIIF standards that can be used and built upon by other institutions and organizations.<br/><br/>

      successor to the original iiif-prezi library.<br/><br/>Developed over the last
      two years by a group of volunteers in the IIIF community, the iiif-prezi3 library
      aims to provide a quick and easy way for developers of all skill levels and
      familiarity with the IIIF Presentation API 3.0 to generate valid JSON-LD for
      Presentation API resources.<br/><br/>During the lightning talk, we will cover
      a brief history of the development of the library, an introduction to the principles
      underlying it such as the use of the Pydantic modeling and validation library,
      and demonstrate some real world examples of the library in use, both inside
      workflows and standalone.

  - abstract: "This short presentation will showcase the work of an ongoing project\
      \ (Jan 2023 \u2013 Jun 2024) led by three early career researchers at the University\
      \ of Glasgow which explores the capability of annotating IIIF images in the\
      \ context of an innovative digital edition. By presenting at the IIIF conference,\
      \ we hope to share our aims and work-in-progress ideas with a wide range of\
      \ experts and users.<br/><br/>The Chronicle of Melrose is one the most significant\
      \ sources for Scotland\u2019s history in the 12th and 13th centuries. It currently\
      \ survives in two composite manuscripts in the British Library in London (Cotton\
      \ Julius B. XIII ff. 2\u201347 and Cotton Faustina B. IX ff. 2\u201375). What\
      \ makes the Chronicle so unique is the fact that so many individual scribes\
      \ (over 50) contributed to its creation and subsequent (messy) growth over a\
      \ century.<br/><br/>Traditional editions tend to be concerned primarily with\
      \ textual content. Where images are used in editions, they are usually illustrative\
      \ rather than the central point of access to the text. On the other hand, it\
      \ has been recognised that a general problem with the plethora of digital images\
      \ of manuscripts on the web is that they often lack sufficient contextualisation\
      \ (e.g. Edwards 2018; Prescott & Hughes 2018). The prospect of integrating IIIF\
      \ images into editions has yet to be generally taken up by the editorial community.\
      \ This project\u2019s innovative image-based edition therefore represents a\
      \ new direction for digital editing and the use of IIIF as part of a \u2018\
      materially engaged\u2019, scribe-centric editorial methodology.<br/><br/>Annotations\
      \ will be added to the images and stored using W3C Web Annotation specification,\
      \ identifying the area where a specific scribal hand occurs. At the same time,\
      \ the TEI-XML texts will be tagged to the relevant scribe ID, matching that\
      \ in the manifest annotation.<br/><br/>Our edition therefore seeks to use the\
      \ BL\u2019s IIIF images to reunite the manuscript (originally divided in the\
      \ 16th century) and draw attention to its messy, multi-scribe nature by annotating\
      \ the scribes on each folio. This will allow for detailed investigations of\
      \ each scribe\u2019s contribution, with accessible referencing and therefore\
      \ verification of research results. As an Open Access edition, it aims to make\
      \ the Chronicle\u2019s scribes and texts available to a wide range of learners,\
      \ researchers and the wider public. The project hopes to demonstrate that by\
      \ using widely supported and shared technologies like IIIF, it is possible to\
      \ create sustainable, Open Access, intellectually ambitious editions which are\
      \ relatively small in scale."

  - abstract: 'Digital Storytelling is one of the most used methods that GLAMs (Galleries,
      Libraries, Archives, Museums) use to display their collections to their audiences.
      Ever since the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) was launched
      in 2011, digital collections have been made highly accessible in a unified standard,
      allowing interoperability between repositories and across applications (IIIF,
      2012-2021a; Freire et al, 2018). However, whilst a lot of efforts are made into
      making data interoperable, we actually do not know how a lot about how IIIF
      material currently is being re-used for storytelling possibilities and/or digital
      public humanities work. Particularly, some key features of IIIF, such as the
      deep-zooming options, metadata, and annotations, can also be leveraged to create
      bespoke digital storytelling options. With the IIIF format now supporting audio
      and video material, these further possibilities for storytelling are even moreso
      enhanced (Roddis, 2018). Through free and IIIF-enabled software such as Exhibit.so
      and Storiiies, the possibility to create a digital story navigating through
      one or multiple images, which mostly leverages the deep zoom functionality of
      IIIF and mixes it with text. Additionally, IIIF has also found its way into
      commercial storytelling software, e.g. Micrio, which is implemented by institutions
      such as the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum to create online navigated and interactive
      ways to explore their museum collections. In recent years, IIIF has furthermore
      expanded its focus of merely sharing images, and has also incorporated audio,
      and video material. When viewing IIIF not only as a technical standard, but
      also as a cocktail of images, audio, video, metadata, annotations, interoperability
      across institutions, and high-quality and high-speed deep zooming, one can think
      of the possibilities this could leverage to tell stories digitally. Yet, when
      analyzing the ways museums and humanities research institutions have implemented
      IIIF within their storytelling and public digital humanities projects, not a
      lot of them have done so. In this lightning talk, I will discuss some of these
      research questions and potentially preliminary results regarding an assesment
      of the user needs for digital storytelling with IIIF. The current user groups
      that I will focus on are the following: (1) humanities scholars, (2) heritage
      and memory practitioners. The goal is to go beyond the deep zoom functionalities
      but analyze how IIIF can play a role in digital storytelling, particularly within
      the field of digital public humanities.'

  - abstract: "This contribution aims at illustrating how the Association of the Italian\
      \ community of Digital Humanities (AIUCD) is encouraging digital scholars to\
      \ adopt the protocol, the framework, the APIs and the tools promoted by the\
      \ IIIF consortium to better meet the requirements arising from the research\
      \ projects over the past few years. Indeed, AIUCD has, among its ambitions,\
      \ that of fostering best practices, common processes, open resources and innovative\
      \ applications in the field of Digital Humanities. The IIIF ecosystem is particularly\
      \ valuable for our community since AIUCD favors 1) data interoperability by\
      \ adopting shared models and standard formats for data representation, 2) data\
      \ availability by using open licenses and web publication following the FAIR\
      \ principles, 3) long-term preservation of scholarly-curated resources by means\
      \ of TRUSTed digital repositories, 4) sustainability of the digital research\
      \ outcomes by strengthening institutional collaborations between different stakeholders\
      \ (academic and non academic ones).<br/><br/>In light of the above, one of the\
      \ most popular technologies adopted within the DH community is the encoding\
      \ schema developed by the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), which is mainly devoted\
      \ to digitally represent any form of textual resources (epigraphs, papyri, manuscripts,\
      \ books, etc.) at different levels of detail, including different research perspectives\
      \ (e.g. paleographical, philological, linguistic, historical and others).<br/><br/>Digital\
      \ textual studies often benefit from the integration of textual data with the\
      \ images of documents bearing texts (including manuscripts, inscriptions, cultural\
      \ heritage objects) and the related metadata. Of special interest, then, is\
      \ to provide shared methods to integrate this kind of textual data representation\
      \ with the image-related data handled by the IIIF APIs, within a Linked Open\
      \ Usable Data context.<br/><br/>Key features of this complex text-document relationship\
      \ that pose modeling and processing challenges include: 1. Producing, managing,\
      \ exposing and retrieving different images about primary sources at different\
      \ levels of granularity and with different image representation technologies\
      \ (RGB, infrared, hyper-spectral, multi-spectral, etc.); 2. Aligning the textual\
      \ content and its internal structure with the image, taking into account that\
      \ different written surfaces and different running texts can coexist within\
      \ the same document image (region of interest, image segmentation, layout analysis,\
      \ text baseline, text masks); 3. Adopting the Web Annotation Data Model (WADM)\
      \ to implement the integration between metadata, text and witness, thus ensuring\
      \ a solid mechanism to generate persistent identifiers (promoting the pointing\
      \ mechanisms of the XML technology and the adherence to RFCs regarding fragment\
      \ identification methods of URI selectors); 4. Adding robust support to 3D images\
      \ through an enhanced IIIF API to manipulate 3D historical documents such as\
      \ epigraphs, papyri, gravestones, etc.<br/><br/>If accepted, the short talk\
      \ will show some use cases beyond \u201Cdeep zoom\u201D requirements, providing\
      \ technical solutions to embed IIIF URI within TEI documents by exploiting attributes\
      \ defined by the teidata.pointer data type, the TEI XPointer Schemes, and the\
      \ WADM specifications implemented within the standoff tagset of a TEI-compliant\
      \ document.<br/><br/>Moreover, we will present some showcases for digital philology,\
      \ developed by members of the AIUCD community, leveraging IIIF APIs: EVT, CophiEditor,\

      \ by Manuscriptorium). That is a major milestone in the development of Manuscriptorium\
      \ as one the biggest aggregators in the field of written cultural heritage,\
      \ effectively making it possible to view as well as research immense digitised\
      \ material available on the internet in one dedicated environment, with one\
      \ prerequisite only: the IIIF compatibility.<br/><br/>The new Manuscriptorium\
      \ Annotation Module allows its users to add notes and comments to the digitised\
      \ documents which they wish to view or further work with. The development of\
      \ the module follows on from previous efforts in Manuscriptorium to disseminate\
      \ personal content as much as possible \u2013 Manuscriptorium has already given\
      \ its users opportunity to create as well as publish their own collections and\
      \ virtual documents in the IIIF format, which was enabled by a tool for generating\
      \ IIIF manifests and collections.<br/><br/>The annotation module goes even further.\
      \ Above all, it enables to create annotations that can then be visualised as\
      \ a fully structured text. Such annotation may relate to a whole virtual document,\
      \ selected page image or even to a chosen image segment. In addition to that,\
      \ the module is interconnected with Manuscriptorium IIIF manifest provider,\
      \ meaning that the system is able to load users' annotations and enrich the\
      \ original document manifest with them. Such enriched manifest then exists separately\
      \ with its own URL and can be used both in Manuscriptorium and outside it, provided\
      \ that the user marks the content as public. It is therefore possible to share\
      \ the enriched manifest with other Manuscriptorium users as well as users of\
      \ other systems. In practice, the users will be able to view the document \u2013\
      \ either in Manuscriptorium, or elsewhere \u2013 along with the added annotations."

  - abstract: 'Throughout the Edo period, an idiosyncratic geometric discourse flourished
      in Japan, surviving in form of the so-called Sangaku: votive tablets presenting
      geometric riddles in word and image, dedicated by private individuals in Buddhist
      temples and Shinto shrines. Around 1000 Sangaku survive to date; spread out
      as they are throughout Japan''s temples, however, their systematic exploration
      and a better understanding of their cultural function remains a challenge and
      the tradition as a whole practically unknown outside of Japan.<br/><br/>Our
      3-year research project based at Waseda University, Tokyo, is an attempt to
      put Sangaku on the map of the global history of mathematics: the first and primary
      objective is to digitize all Sangaku surviving in wood and print and showcase
      them in a bilingual IIIF-based archive.<br/><br/>There is an inherent challenge
      to the project: unlike most digitization initiatives pursued by libraries and
      cultural institutions, the primary material itself is not available in-house
      but held in temples spread out across Japan. To date there is no comprehensive,
      searchable collection of high-resolution images complete with metadata that
      could form a base for a Sangaku archive. Collecting decentralized material in
      such quantity, however, will require a collaborative effort. The project will
      therefore necessitate a workflow that links a user-friendly interface for submitting
      images to a pipeline streamlining the conversion of the material into IIIF manifests.<br/><br/>In
      the lightning talk proposed, we would like to present a pilot for such a pipeline:
      from data collection to database management and the automated creation of IIIF
      manifests.<br/><br/>The requirements are as follows: the submission of data
      should be possible from anywhere and user-friendly; there should be a window
      for control between the submission of data and its conversion to a IIIF manifest;
      the single steps of the process should be automated wherever feasible in order
      to limit manual intervention to a minimum.<br/><br/>The pilot presented uses
      a Google Form for data submission and MySQL for database management; the orchestrator
      is written in Golang. With a view to the future, the final deliverable will
      be a docker container allowing the use of alternative interfaces or databases.<br/><br/>'

  - abstract: "How can we promote IIIF in fields where it is not currently widely\
      \ used?<br/><br/>In France, even though IIIF is for example commonly used in\
      \ libraries, very few archives have implemented the IIIF APIs. In 2022 a project,\
      \ born from the reflexions of Biblissima+ and the Service Interminist\xE9riel\
      \ des Archives de France, came to light. The aim of this project is to promote\
      \ the implementation of IIIF in the French archival network, for their own benefit,\
      \ but also in order to aggregate archival content on the French national portal\
      \ for archives, FranceArchives (managed by the Service Interminist\xE9riel des\
      \ Archives de France).<br/><br/>The purpose of this presentation is to introduce\
      \ this project, as our approach could inspire others. In the first part, we\
      \ will describe the different stages of the strategy developed to diffuse IIIF\
      \ in archival institutions, in connection with archivists and software providers.\
      \ This includes writing documentation and specifications, whose goal is to promote\
      \ good and homogeneous practices on a national scale, for instance for the construction\
      \ of ARKs. Training courses are also launched, which allows us to give feedback\
      \ on how to acquaint a non technical audience with IIIF.<br/><br/>Secondly,\
      \ we will present the other goal of this project: aggregating archival content\
      \ in FranceArchives, in order to provide federated access and to enable better\
      \ discoverability of these resources. It will be the opportunity to mention\
      \ how manifests and digital contents are retrieved and integrated into the document's\
      \ descriptive notes, thanks to the implementation of Mirador 3. Future projects,\
      \ as in the implementation of valorization tools, will also be discussed.<br/><br/>FranceArchives,\
      \ as the French national provider for Archives Portal Europe, the domain agregator\
      \ for archives of Europeana, will therefore be part of an European network of\
      \ IIIF. The portal will also aim to offer repositories in IIIF for thematic\
      \ portals such as Biblissima."

      \ communities for over twenty years. Our most important product DInGO (\"Digitise\
      \ and Go\") has been used by hundreds of institutions in Poland and abroad.\
      \ PSNC serves more than 140 deployments of digital GLAMs in total. Among them\
      \ there are over a dozen of institutions using professional digitization pipelines\
      \ and archiving solutions implemented in the DInGO toolset. Recent years at\
      \ PSNC have been full of projects using IIIF technology, allowing end users\
      \ to work with easily accessible high-quality images. Our production systems\
      \ use IIP Image Server and Cantaloupe as well as OpenSeadragon and UniversalViewer.\
      \ In order to provide images in IIIF compliant format we implemented various\
      \ conversion routines. In our presentation we would like to show our approaches\
      \ to use of IIIF technology in production systems:<br/>- Data Exchange Infrastructure\
      \ developed in EnrichEuropeana and EnrichEuropeana+ projects,<br/>- Virtual\
      \ Transcription Laboratory implemented in cooperation with variety of partners,<br/>-\
      \ dLibra system, our flagship software for digital collections management.<br/><br/>Moreover\
      \ we would like to present our first approach for providing IIIF images in a\
      \ large scale system developed within the DARIAH-PL project.<br/><br/>EnrichEuropeana\
      \ and EnrichEuropeana+ aim to encourage various communities to improve digital\
      \ objects quality by creating transcriptions and metadata enrichments. Cultural\
      \ heritage digital objects often contain scans of handwritten documents or images\
      \ with unstructured textual information. Transcribing such scans requires working\
      \ with the images in high zoom which made the IIIF technology the best choice.\
      \ The solution uses images at their original locations or prepared internally\
      \ using conversion from other data formats and exposed via IIP Image Server.\
      \ Images are shown to the users in the customized version of OpenSeadragon viewer\
      \ embedded in the Transcribathon Platform. In addition to manual transcriptions,\
      \ the Transcribathon Platform uses HTR technology mainly to create automatic\
      \ transcriptions of manuscripts.<br/><br/>Virtual Transcription Laboratory supports\
      \ digital repositories in enhancing their content with transcriptions, translations,\
      \ transliterations and annotations. The tool works on IIIF-based image streams\
      \ served by the internal IIIF server whenether conversion to IIIF compliant\
      \ format is necessary. Built-in OCR engine together with its automatic training\
      \ routines helps preparing good quality transcriptions of documents. Different\
      \ types of text enhancements are stored in separate text layers which are searchable\
      \ using IIIF Search API. VTL is integrated with the digital repository in the\
      \ manner of providing the text enhancements as alternative representations of\
      \ digital resources.<br/><br/>dLibra has also been enhanced with IIIF technology\
      \ to help hundreds of institutions publish their digital resources online. Internally\
      \ it uses Cantaloupe IIIF server and UniversalViewer which beside IIIF streams\
      \ is able to work with legacy image galleries.<br/><br/>In the DARIAH-PL project\
      \ we are increasing the scale of using IIIF technology. The data delivery service\
      \ will not only allow serving the images but also converting other formats to\
      \ IIIF compliant format. The most significant feature of the system will be\
      \ its scale, both in terms of the number of servers and the size of storage."

  - abstract: The use of digital technologies to preserve and promote endangered languages
      is becoming increasingly important in light of the rapid decline of many linguistic
      traditions. In Japan, where a rich tapestry of endangered languages face the
      risk of extinction, the adaptation of the International Image Interoperability
      Framework (IIIF) to include audio and video content offers a promising solution.<br/><br/>In
      Japan, a diverse array of endangered languages, such as the Ryukyuan and Ainu
      languages, face a similar risk of extinction due to declining numbers of speakers
      and a lack of preservation and documentation resources. To address this issue,
      the adaptation of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)
      to include audio and video content is seen as a promising solution.<br/><br/>The
      National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics (NINJAL) holds many
      unpublished resources on endangered languages in Japan. To make these resources
      accessible to the public, NINJAL created the NINJAL Digital Archive (NINDA),
      based on Omeka S, and equipped with a rich interface featuring three IIIF viewers
      and RDF metadata output functions. Users can play audio and video content using
      Universal Viewer and Mirador, with the latter allowing for the display of subtitles,
      including phonetic representation and translation.<br/><br/>The adaptation of
      IIIF for audio and video files in Japan will promote the sharing and reuse of
      digital collections. Standardizing the IIIF specifications for these files will
      provide a consistent way for institutions to represent and share their collections,
      enabling the development of new access and analysis tools. The use of IIIF will
      also allow researchers to cross-reference and compare resources from different
      institutions, increasing overall understanding and knowledge of these endangered
      languages.<br/><br/>However, the adaptation of IIIF for audio and video files
      will require the development of new technical specifications and tools to represent
      and interpret audio and video content. Issues such as file format compatibility,
      syncing of audio and video streams with subtitles, and access to alternate versions
      and derivatives of content must be addressed in the IIIF specifications for
      audio and video. Additionally, new metadata standards and controlled vocabularies
      are needed to describe resources and facilitate discovery and access, including
      language and dialect identification, speaker information, and cultural context.<br/><br/>To
      conclude, the adaptation of IIIF to audio and video files will require the development
      of updated technical specifications and tools to provide the representation
      and interpretation of the audio and video content. As part of the IIIF specifications
      for audio and video, a number of issues will need to be addressed, including
      file format compatibility, synchronizing audio and video streams with subtitles,
      and the ability to access alternate versions and derivatives of content. Additionally,
      new metadata standards and controlled vocabulary are needed to describe resources
      and facilitate discovery and access to these valuable resources for heritage
      learners and linguistic enthusiasts.<br/><br/>

  - abstract: Many scholars and institutions face a similar technical and sustainability
      / reuse problem. They have high quality images of manuscripts, early printed
      books, or other resources which are not easily OCR'd using standard off-the-shelf
      OCR tools or services. They may also have good quality text for these documents,
      created through expert or crowd-sourced transcription, stored as plaintext,
      markdown, or TEI-XML.<br/><br/>In many cases these might have been created as
      part of a digital critical edition, or a one-off scholarly project which has
      no easy route to sustainable delivery via open IIIF APIs after the project ends.
      There are many legacy projects of this type.<br/><br/>At the moment, there is
      no easy way to bring these together via a IIIF viewer or IIIF-aware interface
      if the transcript text contains no spatial information that can be mapped to
      regions of a IIIF canvas.<br/><br/>I will demonstrate one approach in which
      we use line and word level segmentation information and low quality text from
      OCR and HTR tools, including Transformer based ML workflows, to retrofit existing
      transcripts to IIIF images, with bounding boxes suitable for use in IIIF Content
      Search and IIIF annotation use cases. In this way, existing scholarship can
      be reused, rather than discarded, and brought together with images via the IIIF
      Presentation API as part of a sustainable approach to collection delivery.<br/><br/>I
      will present an overview of the approach, including some comparisons of different
      open source and commodity approaches to generating text and segmentation data
      and some brief quantitative information summarising the algorithmic approach
      to matching transcript to image and then demo some real world examples.<br/><br/>I
      will also provide access to a demo where conference attendees can test the approach
      themselves.<br/><br/>

  - abstract: '<br/><br/>From 2020-2023, an UK-Ireland joint research networking project
      ''IIIF4Research'' brought together researchers and heritage practitioners at
      universities in the UK and Ireland to investigate the potential for innovative
      forms of scholarly discussion and interchange offered by the International Image
      Interoperability Framework (IIIF). The network explored examples of the ways
      that IIIF enables much easier sharing, annotation and manipulation of digital
      images from libraries, archives, galleries, and museums across institutional
      and national boundaries, and offers researchers exciting new possibilities for
      joint analysis, documentation and discussion of primary materials, situating
      IIIF in the broader context of digital humanities.<br/><br/>The network carried
      out two key activities: it carried out a survey of researchers'' use of iiif,
      which helped build our understanding of a the use and impact of iiif, and its
      place in the research life cycle. It also carried out a series of workshops,
      building dialogue between arts and humanities researchers, curators and information
      professionals intended to develop research-driven agendas for the deployment
      and development of IIIF to investigate a wide range of primary materials and
      archives relevant to humanities research domains. The workshops demonstrated
      the many different ways in which IIIF supports innovative analysis and commentary
      on the various types of source material used by arts and humanities researchers,
      and were the basis for a series of user cases showcasing how the facilities
      offered by IIIF are valuable in addressing particular research questions.<br/><br/>This
      presentation will discuss the findings of these activities, and how they might
      facilitate future development of IIIF and encourage scholarly engagement with
      the potential of IIIF. '

      to extend the core capabilities through the use of external services. One of
      these services, present since early 2014, is thy Physical Dimension service,
      which allows a IIIF canvas or image to indicate the real-world size of the image
      or object depicted.<br/><br/>To demonstrate the capabilities of this service,
      I've written a small application that lets people create print-ready IIIF images,
      appropriately scaled for various uses.<br/><br/>Do you want a Van Gogh for your
      Lego Minifigs? A Cassatt for your American Girl? Or do you just want to print

      \ This link is then used to create a new transcription project in From The Page.\
      \ Here, transcribers and domain experts transcribe the texts in a public crowdsourcing\
      \ environment. These transcriptions are then vetted and approved by one of the\
      \ project\u2019s editors. The editors can then export the completed transcriptions\
      \ and associated page images to FairCopy via From The Page\u2019s IIIF export\
      \ option.<br/><br/>FairCopy is a specialized word processor for the study and\
      \ transcription of primary sources in literature and history. It reads and writes\
      \ texts marked up in XML according to the Text Encoding Initiative\u2019s Guidelines\
      \ (TEI). We are using FairCopy in the Native Bound Unbound project to structure\
      \ and annotate transcriptions and translations in a variety of formats. For\
      \ each primary source, the transcription and images flow in via IIIF. Users\
      \ are able to select texts from the annotation lists in the manifest. These\
      \ are then assembled into TEI in FairCopy.<br/><br/>The FairCopy interface can\
      \ be customized for each project so that editors just have the elements and\
      \ attributes they need for the job. Users can also markup up names of people\
      \ and places, as well as identify events. Each asset type requires a specific\
      \ markup strategy. Fortunately, TEI is quite flexible in this regard and FairCopy\
      \ makes the process easier and more approachable to our non-technical collaborators.<br/><br/>FairCopy\
      \ integrates with ArchivEngine, an open source server which provides version\
      \ control and team collaboration. Using ArchivEngine, team members can check\
      \ out texts to edit and check them in when they are done. ArchiveEngine publishes\
      \ the texts as a IIIF Manifest via a public API.<br/><br/>ArchivEngine\u2019\
      s IIIF manifests are then used to display the texts on the public site. This\
      \ display utilizes EditionCrafter, an open source React component that can display\
      \ IIIF images alongside their TEI encoded transcriptions and translations. The\
      \ translation texts are linked to a database of people, place, and event entries\
      \ which are also derived from the TEI encoded texts.<br/><br/>"

      \ to provide a user with the ability to zoom into more detailed views of an\
      \ object (Image API) and examine it via multiple images (Presentation API).<br/><br/>This\
      \ complementarity leads those institutions implementing relightable images and\

    title: IIIF 3D - Technical Specification Group Workshop
    type: Workshop
  - abstract: "In the last years IIIF became the \u201Cde facto\u201D standard for\
      \ presenting, navigating and delivering digital images on the web all over the\
      \ world. It defines several APIs for providing a standard method for describing,\
      \ analysing and sharing images over the web, as well as \"presentation-based\
      \ metadata\" about structured sequences of images. However, images and, in particular,\
      \ cultural heritage images, to be fully analysed, interpreted and enjoyed should\
      \ be inserted in a \u201Cvirtual ecosystem\u201D in which they can be related\
      \ with entities such as people, places, events, fonds, etc., according to different\
      \ visions and interpretations.<br/><br/>Therefore, since 2017, we have been\
      \ working at integrating IIIF in a Digital Library environment based on DSpace,\
      \ the most used Open source Digital Asset Management System, developing a dedicated\
      \ addon (starting from version 5), easily integrated with a set of external\
      \ Image Servers, such as Cantaloupe or Digilib, and at extending DSpace data\
      \ model as well, to structure contextual relationships among cultural heritage\
      \ entities at different levels.<br/><br/>After DSpace 7 release, we worked with\
      \ the community at integrating IIIF support in the official DSpace codebase.\
      \ Now the DSpace REST API implements the IIIF Presentation API version 2.1.1,\
      \ the IIIF Image API version 2.1.1, and the IIIF Search API version 1.0 (experimental).\
      \ Any IIIF compliant image server can be integrated. The DSpace Angular frontend\
      \ uses the Mirador 3.0 viewer.<br/><br/>However, Digital Library requirements\
      \ are getting complex and complex. Therefore, to fulfil the needs of the cultural\
      \ heritage domain, we enhanced our solutions based on DSpace 7, developing two\
      \ further add-ons to integrate and enrich the \u201CIIIF experience\u201D within\
      \ DSpace: the Document Viewer (for visualizing PDF files within Mirador) and\
      \ the OCR module (for extracting text from images and indexing it).<br/><br/>Integrating\
      \ IIIF and DSpace 7 and enriching the platform with new features, it has been\
      \ possible to go beyond the traditional boundaries of the Digital libraries,\
      \ structuring a complex system of relationships, building new narratives thanks\
      \ to interdisciplinarity and the coexistence of different domains.<br/><br/>The\
      \ proposed 2 hours workshop, addressed to librarians, archivists, historians,\
      \ archaeologists, researchers and to all those who want to build their own digital\
      \ library with DSpace 7 and IIIF, will introduce the attendees to the IIIF integration\
      \ in DSpace both from the backend and from the frontend side.<br/><br/>We will\
      \ analyze and share our approach and standard workflows for managing cultural\
      \ heritage documents in DSpace using IIIF, starting with images submission and\
      \ describing the operations required to make images available to the Mirador\
      \ Image Viewer, the ones for extracting the text via OCR and for visualizing\
      \ PDFs through the Image Viewer. Moreover, we will show how to relate items\
      \ to each other, in order to build a complex system of relationships between\
      \ entities, to be explored through network graphs. "

  - abstract: Archipelago Commons is a stable and well maintained OSS repository system
      that integrates user facing IIIF capabilities all across its architecture and
      stack. From Dynamic Manifest generation (both 2.1 and 3), W3C Annotations, OCR
      extraction and discovery, direct access to descriptive metadata with rich LoD
      and side by side technical metadata, configurable discovery to fully configured
      and ready to use IIIF Image API server with extensions for multiple types of
      Media. The system also provides, out of the box, a selection of the most popular
      IIIF capable media viewers in up to date versions and variations.<br/><br/>These
      features and tools provide a great opportunity for community members that are
      learning the IIIF spec(s) and want to experiment with these in a safe space
      without having to manually deploy and configure individual tools, lowering the
      entry barrier to IIIF. This also allows more advanced users to bring their own
      assets, media, needs, questions, metadata, even in different languages, and
      evaluate (or dream) IIIF implementations under their own individual or institutional
      realities, constraints and contexts.<br/><br/>During this 4 hour workshop participants
      will learn how to use and customize a curated selection of adapted IIIF Cookbook
      examples, in specific those targeting the IIIF Presentation and image API version
      3, using a locally deployable and dockerized Archipelago Commons configured
      to serve as a learning ground. Users will be encouraged to bring their own assets
      and Metadata, work collaboratively with their peers, and to critically evaluate
      how IIIF can leverage their collections.<br/><br/>Participants will be provided
      with a simple and fully automated local deployment upfront, written 101 documentation,
      example Digital Objects and a guided set of tasks to execute during the first
      2 hours of the workshop. Tricks of trade, Media and File Formats, specs and
      their implementations in Viewers will be discussed. The second part will provide
      participants with space to experiment on their own, by testing, adapting and
      learning how to build a fully customized IIIF presentation Manifest to fulfill
      a specific need while collaborating with their peers. The organizers will be
      supporting each participant interactively. Focus will be put on providing a
      respectful and inclusive environment following the IIIF Community code of conduct.<br/><br/>Even
      if participants already run their own platform of choice(s) and/or do not intent
      to use Archipelago in production at all, the unique approach of having a single
      system that can cover most of the IIIF specifications and provides an easy way
      to test the amazing IIIF community developed Cookbook recipes with their own
      and real Digital Objects and Media, presenters will endeavor to lead participants
      into a wider discussion about IIIF specifications best practices, File format
      choices and Viewer selection. This workshop will be principally geared towards
      a general audience.<br/><br/>

    title: IIIF 3D - Evolution, Technical Specification, Future Metaverse?
    type: Presentation
  - abstract: 'This year, the Bodleian Libraries and the Factum Foundation have undertaken
      a pioneering project exploring the use of high-resolution 3D and color recording
      in the study of books and other items in library collections. Historically,
      the digitization of surface relief in books and manuscripts has been given little
      consideration. However, this project, known as ArchiOX, has demonstrated the
      great potential of high-resolution 3D scanning in this area of study.<br/><br/>Two
      complementary recording systems were used in the project: the Lucida 3D laser
      triangulation Scanner and the Selene Photometric Stereo Scanner. Both systems
      were designed and developed specifically for cultural heritage documentation.
      One of the key objectives of the project was to make the recorded data available
      seamlessly within the IIIF ecosystem, allowing for both depthmap and normal
      map 3D scan data to be recorded as image files, often referred to as 2.5D. Over
      a period of one year, a new methodology for processing these images for publication
      in IIIF viewers was developed, as well as a virtual relighting tool that allows
      researchers to observe objects as if they were physically in front of them,
      by moving a virtual torch around their surfaces. This tool reveals details of
      the objects'' surface that may not be visible at first glance (with or without
      the color information)<br/><br/>The implementation of a IIIF-compatible viewer
      for 3D scans opens up exciting new possibilities for library collections, enabling
      researchers and the general public to engage with their unique objects in innovative
      ways. The virtual relighting tool allows us to study objects in greater detail
      and has already proved to be a valuable tool in the analysis and interpretation
      of the collections. The results of this ongoing project have far-reaching implications
      for the study and preservation of cultural heritage.<br/><br/>'

  #     \ including ~1024 Arabic and Syriac manuscripts which have been imaged and published\
  #     \ online through the Sinai Manuscripts Digital Library (SMDL). SMDL provides\
  #     \ access to high-resolution images of these manuscripts, along with descriptive\
  #     \ metadata. However, like many early manuscripts, the majority of Sinai manuscripts\
  #     \ contain complexity at multiple levels \u2013 they comprise multiple works\
  #     \ and/or codicological units; they have been disassembled and rebound in new\
  #     \ configurations; and there are hundreds of documented palimpsests and dispersed\
  #     \ fragments within the collection. All too often, the environments where we\
  #     \ publish manuscript collections at scale elide these complex structures, which\
  #     \ are crucial to understanding the histories and contexts of manuscripts and\
  #     \ manuscript collections. IIIF, having radically impacted our ability to reimagine\
  #     \ early manuscripts through digital means, brings with it an opportunity to\
  #     \ model and contextualize digital manuscripts and their data, allowing us to\
  #     \ represent and untangle the inherent complexities of early manuscripts.<br/><br/>This\
  #     \ presentation will share how the SMDL is using IIIF to model and represent\
  #     \ the complexities of early manuscripts in digital environments at scale, including\
  #     \ modeling the materiality and structure of manuscripts as well as content and\
  #     \ context; representing uncertainty and lacunae; and supporting digital reconstruction\
  #     \ of palimpsested texts and disbound and dispersed manuscripts and their fragments.\
  #     \ While these are not necessarily unique uses of IIIF for modeling complex objects,\
  #     \ the SMDL provides real-world examples for showcasing how IIIF can expose these\
  #     \ complexities in large-scale manuscript repositories.<br/><br/>We will also\
  #     \ discuss the work the SMDL is undertaking to develop a new modular manuscripts\
  #     \ data model that is aligned with the IIIF Presentation API and Web Annotation\
  #     \ to better support digital reconstruction, rebinding, experimental editions,\
  #     \ and enhanced descriptions of manuscripts by the project team and scholars/end\
  #     \ users. Our goal is to provide the tools and data needed to study manuscripts\
  #     \ and their components both individually and in \u201Cparts to whole\u201D relationships,\
  #     \ and to reconfigure and re-contextualize these objects within digital spaces.<br/><br/>The\
  #     \ presentation should be of interest to generalists and specialists alike, including\

  #   type: Presentation
  - abstract: 'The scenario of the Italian IIIF museums is quite uneven due to a still
      initial phase in the process of digitizing the collections. Nonetheless, the
      emphasis on how to describe and interpret historical art collections, through
      the IIIF framework, attracts the attention of institutions whose environments
      and connotations are heavily decorated. A research project, involving researchers
      and students of the Venice Center for Digital and Public Humanities, aims to
      write the IIIF Manifests for the Galleria Borghese digital catalog in Rome.<br/><br/>The
      museum has a distinctive aspect characterized by a peculiar decorative apparatus
      through which the collection of sculptures, paintings, and furniture is displayed.
      It is a challenge when describing each object in digital form. In this context,
      the spatial component plays an important role in highlighting the decorations,
      stucco, marble, and tiles around the artwork. In order to render the complexity
      of its spaces, the museum undertook a photographic and photogrammetric digitization
      project to create navigable virtual models of the rooms.<br/><br/>The IIIF ecosystem
      has been adopted to fit into this model, describing each museum room that was
      taken with equirectangular photographs. The images were treated as if they were
      maps to investigate and comment on, guiding the user in an amplified modality
      of the virtual tour. The first results of this process of describing 360 images
      will present a comparison of two versions: one using a model that benefits from
      the last update of the API 3.0, and the other a variant that adopts the simple
      annotation server. In general, the IIIF Presentation API structure allows creators
      to build different relations among the resources. This operation is generally
      accomplished through the annotations element which allows linking the IIIF digital
      object with other resources.<br/><br/>In this case study, by examining the whole
      Galleria Borghese collection and its physical division, we aimed to integrate
      the multiple relations that here occur into the different IIIF Manifests. To
      provide users with a highly immersive experience, we designed the Manifest as
      a linked path structured in whole-part relations. This approach supports users
      in browsing between the rooms and the artworks contained there.<br/><br/>In
      accordance with the standard guidelines, we built these relations using the
      IIIF annotation system along the Mirador viewer. The combination of these frameworks
      enables to the provision of an end-to-end environment where resources could
      be described, referenced, and linked with other resources.<br/><br/>The contribution
      is addressed to both the general public and museum professionals. For the latter
      in particular, the adoption of this model could facilitate the curation of collections
      as well as collaboration in educational activities by integrating with the Storiiies
      editor tool.<br/><br/>'

    title: The implementation of the Galleria Borghese VR using the IIIF annotation
      tool
    type: Presentation
  - abstract: "This presentation demonstrates how novel IIIF-powered tools benefit\
      \ the research on scientific imagery in a historical perspective. Our case study,\
      \ the Rara Magnetica research project (www.raramagnetica.de), uses the IIIF\
      \ Presentation API to drive a research workflow and assist in the generation\
      \ of the final research outputs, thereby extending well beyond a \u201Cdeep\
      \ zoom on images\u201D.<br/><br/>Rara Magnetica is both a repository and an\
      \ interactive research platform. It publishes scans and transcriptions of sources,\
      \ data visualizations, and databases, all related to the premodern study of\
      \ magnetism. Moreover, it provides various tools to investigate each of these\
      \ resources independently and in combination. A major aim in fact is to enhance\
      \ multimodal analyses that transcend media barriers by allowing research of\
      \ imagery along with full texts, material sources along with their conceptual\
      \ content. This is achieved by various but interlinked tools, such as ICAT,\
      \ providing different ways of looking at the same sources.<br/><br/>Researchers\
      \ working with historical multi-page documents, such as books or manuscripts,\
      \ often lack a tool to store, annotate, and explore these documents in complex\
      \ ways, extending to the documents\u2019 metadata, its full texts and its imagery\
      \ or illustrations. ICAT is a Digital Humanities tool to serve this entire workflow,\
      \ by employing IIIF APIs and linking to third-party tools, such as Zotero, Transkribus,\
      \ and Vikus Viewer. Digitised copies of many of the historical documents making\
      \ up the Rara Magnetica collection are available from their holding institutions\
      \ via IIIF services. These resources can be transcribed and structured with\
      \ Transkribus and image regions on the pages can be detected and marked with\
      \ bounding boxes using computer vision tools such as Cordeep (https://cordeep.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/).\
      \ ICAT coordinates this provision of data and also implements a workflow for\
      \ annotating the content of those images. Powered by IIIF Presentation API objects\
      \ (especially Annotations) and OpenSeadragon, multiple users can collaboratively\
      \ tag these images using a controlled and hierarchical semantic vocabulary.<br/><br/>Tags\
      \ can be exported as annotations against new IIIF manifests, as well as in JSON\
      \ and CSV formats for integration with other tools, such as Vikus Viewer (https://github.com/cpietsch/vikus-viewer).\
      \ While all ICAT data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, the ICAT UI and API\
      \ also allows for complex searches across the documents and the image tags.\
      \ The presentation of the search results is rendered both as IIIF Content Search\
      \ API responses targeted at the original manifests, and also as on-the-fly dynamic\
      \ IIIF manifests to provide an interface for researchers to discover and explore\
      \ imagery in combination with semantic metadata.<br/><br/>Our joint conference\
      \ presentation will demonstrate a use case and workflow for how IIIF manifests\
      \ are imported into ICAT for tagging, how they subsequently become the subject\
      \ to complex searches, and how search results can be displayed in the IIIF Presentation\
      \ API. What ICAT thus offers is a platform for server-based storage, annotation,\
      \ and exploration of imagery in multi-page documents, such as books or manuscripts."

  - abstract: "The Mmmonk project aims to contribute to the development of IIIF by\
      \ providing input from a non-institutional end user\u2019s perspective on various\
      \ issues, among which IIIF annotations. The user survey conducted at the start\
      \ of the project showed that users were ambiguous about IIIF annotations. On\
      \ the one hand, they were highly enthusiastic about the concept in general and\
      \ acknowledged that it meant an advancement in working with digital images.\
      \ On the other hand, upon deeper reflection, they were put off by a set of practical\
      \ obstacles. A recurring concern was tied to the nature of the material studied\
      \ by our end users and highlighted by Mmmonk: medieval manuscripts. This type\
      \ of object is complex and multidimensional. Its digital counterpart is not\
      \ a single image but a set of images of the binding, spine, and - often numerous\
      \ - pages. On top of this, manuscripts are studied from a wide variety of disciplines\
      \ or perspectives, for instance for their material and chemical properties,\
      \ text, script, decoration, binding and provenance marks. The targeted end users\
      \ were concerned that it would be overwhelming and confusing to see such variety\
      \ and volume of information gathered in the setting of a viewer.<br/><br/>We\
      \ therefore designed a proof-of-concept for the visualization of various layers\
      \ of information in a structured and user-friendly way, which can be applied\
      \ to manuscripts but also to other types of objects.. For this demo we have\
      \ annotated four bifolia of the 12th century Liber Floridus at Ghent University.\
      \ Within the constraints of the project, we focused on finding the optimal information\
      \ architecture and user experience. We appropriated the visual language of Mirador\
      \ 3 using Material UI and simulated a basic Mirador viewer and built our custom\
      \ interface on top.<br/><br/>The user survey also pointed out that individual\
      \ end users have concerns about authorship attribution and peer-review in IIIF-annotations.\
      \ Although this was not the focus of our proof-of-concept, we did include a\
      \ solution to credit authors and sources within the boundaries of a curated\
      \ editorial project with various authors. In our experiment, we imagined a group\
      \ of researchers working in various fields, whom we invited to contribute content\
      \ in compliance with editorial guidelines designed by Mmmonk. This setting could\
      \ also apply to other situations, for instance students working on a group project\
      \ under the supervision of a teacher.<br/><br/>Discover the proof-of-concept\

  - abstract: "Italy offers a long and solid tradition in manuscript studies. The\
      \ access to this material has always been subject to limitations, both for the\
      \ rarity and fragility of the document and for the scarcity and low quality\
      \ of photographic reproductions. Only recently the country has begun more systematic\
      \ digitization campaigns and online archiving of its enormous heritage (among\
      \ the largest in the world). The panel brings together in three sessions the\
      \ pioneers of IIIF in Italian-language bibliographic culture, namely the University\
      \ of Federico II (F2), the Vatican Library (BAV) and the Central Institute for\
      \ the Unique Catalogue (ICCU).<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>F2 highlights the usefulness\
      \ of the IIIF framework for a thematic project such as Illuminated Dante Project,\
      \ and explains the efforts in achieving a first descriptive model for illuminated\
      \ manuscripts. It then presents Naples Dante Project (NDP), a web-based archive\
      \ displaying the whole manuscript sources of Dante\u2019s works, as well as\
      \ illustrations of the Commedia from manuscripts to 20th-century books. NDP\
      \ is working on: 1. a new F.A.I.R.-compliant model for manuscript description\
      \ and iconography (partner Venice VePDH); 2. a IIIF annotation tool to support\
      \ iconographic, paleographic and textual-criticism analysis; 3. a IIIF-compliant\
      \ tool for creating thematic paths for dissemination and educational purposes;\
      \ 4. visualizing RTI images within the IIIF (partners KU Leuven and CNR-ISTI);\
      \ 5. HTR training on Dante manuscripts (partners ENC and CNR-ILC); 6. the image\
      \ matching on Dante miniatures (partner BAV).<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>BAV has implemented\
      \ its IIIF-compliant digital library (DVL) platform and the Thematic Pathways\
      \ on the Web project (in conjunction with Stanford University Libraries), aimed\
      \ to demonstrate, among the advantages of the IIIF for manuscripts, how the\
      \ annotation level is a fundamental innovation for the study of contents: transcriptions,\
      \ comments, comparative analysis of texts and images. As a current challenge,\
      \ the BAV is conducting a case study in the field of machine learning and IIIF.\
      \ This talk will focus on the experience of training of a neural network, based\
      \ on segmented digital images, pertaining to a selection of illuminated manuscripts\
      \ and the implementation of IIIF annotations of regions of pages, classified\
      \ by the network, corresponding to the segmented portions of images.<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>This\
      \ talk introduces Alphabetica, the gateway to the national bibliographic databases\
      \ managed by the ICCU. This platform includes the OPAC SBN, the Census of Italian\
      \ 16th-century Editions (EDIT 16), the Catalogue of Ancient and Modern Manuscripts\
      \ (ManusOnline), and other thematic databases, along with a IIIF-compliant digital\
      \ library service, capable of linking digital resources to the library holdings,\
      \ for the benefit of over 7.000 Italian libraries. These are different types\
      \ of libraries, with different administrative affiliations adhering to the SBN\
      \ community, and of many other libraries contributing in the enrichment of our\
      \ national specialized databases. The talk will also highlight the opportunities\
      \ that Alphabetica provides, thanks to the IIIF protocol, for both research\
      \ and educational purposes. Finally, the presentation illustrates the role of\
      \ Alphabetica logical model and design within the forthcoming implementation\
      \ of the National Digital Library including all the digital assets coming from\
      \ the Italian cultural heritage.<br/><br/>"

    title: IIIF Maps Implementations
    type: Presentation
  - abstract: "Allmaps is a set of open source tools for georeferencing, warping,\
      \ viewing and exploring digitized maps that are available with IIIF. Geographic\
      \ metadata is stored in a simple Web Annotation that can be embedded in the\
      \ IIIF Presentation API. Together with the IIIF Community, a specification for\
      \ such Georeference Annotations is in the making, with the aim to be published\
      \ as an official IIIF Extension.<br/><br/>At the 2021 Annual Conference, we\
      \ presented Allmaps for the first time and demonstrated the various components\
      \ that were still in early development. Since then, we have had the pleasure\
      \ to meet many curators, researchers, educators and developers around the world\
      \ who are interested in using Allmaps and who would like to contribute to its\
      \ further development.<br/><br/>This presentation highlights a selection of\
      \ use cases that we have collected over the past two years, in combination with\
      \ live demonstrations. In addition, we discuss how the project can evolve into\
      \ a more robust network organization, and how the overall accessibility and\
      \ usability for wider audiences can be improved.<br/><br/>The use cases follow\
      \ the perspectives of institutions, researchers and students. For institutions\
      \ that have previously engaged in georeferencing projects, Allmaps offers a\
      \ way to simplify their infrastructure and serve geographic data as part of\
      \ the IIIF Presentation API. Allmaps offers tools to convert data from other\
      \ formats to Georeference Annotations, and plugins to turn IIIF images into\
      \ map layers in popular map viewers. All of this can be hosted on premises.<br/><br/>For\
      \ institutions that have not yet georeferenced their collection, the Allmaps\
      \ Editor can be used to set up crowdsourcing projects. The resulting data can\
      \ be retrieved from Allmaps and kept as part of the collection. We highlight\
      \ the use cases of both Leiden University Libraries and the Leventhal Map &\
      \ Education Center at the Boston Public Library.<br/><br/>Researchers working\
      \ with digital collections often struggle getting access to data and setting\
      \ up complex infrastructures. Long term server maintenance is often a problem.\
      \ IIIF in combination with Allmaps makes it possible to set up a static workflow\
      \ that requires less server maintenance and improves sustainability. The Allmaps\
      \ Tile Server increases the compatibility with traditional GIS applications.\
      \ After finalizing projects, research results can be more easily shared with\
      \ the providing institutions in the form of Web Annotations. We highlight the\
      \ use cases of OpenHistoricalMap and the French interdisciplinary research project\
      \ SODUCO.<br/><br/>For students, Allmaps improves the overall accessibility\
      \ and usability of georeferenced map collections. It gives students more freedom\
      \ to collect and compare material from different sources at their own initiative.\
      \ WebGL color masking and colorization in the Allmaps Viewer helps to compare\
      \ different overlays. Moreover, for design students, Allmaps makes it possible\
      \ to georeference architectural and urban plans, in order to study designs in\
      \ a larger context and compare different solutions. We highlight the use case\
      \ of Delft University of Technology\u2019s Faculty of Architecture and the Built\
      \ Environment."

  - abstract: "1a. Crowdsourcing and IIIF<br/><br/>In the first part of the workshop,\
      \ we will talk about crowdsourcing using IIIF, specifically in the cultural\
      \ and natural heritage sector. In this workshop, we will centralize the various\
      \ user and stakeholder types (e.g. \u2018the crowd\u2019, scientific\
      \ audiences, cultural heritage sector, academics...), and what exactly\
      \ their requirements and needs are for crowdsourcing (with IIIF). To do so,\
      \ we will report on user research undertaken by the Flemish Art Collection in\
      \ Flanders (VKC), which conducted user surveys to try and determine\
      \ do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for (IIIF) crowdsourcing, as well as our\
      \ own experiences with use cases for crowdsourcing. We will talk about\
      \ the context and outcomes of this user research, offer some visualizations\
      \ through user personas, and discuss the recurring needs and requirements.<br/><br/>Following\
      \ an outline of the user research, we will take on a more interactive approach\
      \ in the workshop. Through some interactive exercises, we will facilitate\
      \ a brainstorm on how IIIF can be a solution for these user needs,\
      \ and what future requirements are needed to meet them. We will reflect\
      \ on how crowdsourcing specialists and volunteers could benefit from existing solutions,\
      \ software and/or platforms that perhaps already meet some of these user needs, and\
      \ think about newer features. The goal of this workshop is to bring together\
      \ a variety of parties interested in crowdsourcing with IIIF, to foster\
      \ an international community.<br/><br/>1b. Madoc as a platform for crowdsourcing:\
      \ Needs, Requirements and Roadmap<br/><br/>In the second part of the workshop,\
      \ we will start with an introduction to the platform Madoc, by demonstrating\
      \ some specific crowdsourcing use cases by various institutions. Madoc is an\
      \ open source platform for the enrichment of IIIF digital objects. We will provide\
      \ a comprehensive understanding of Madoc for attendees and how it can\
      \ be applied to various annotation and crowdsourcing use cases. We\
      \ will also discuss some of the viewpoints of why certain features\
      \ were requested, based on use cases and experiences of GhentCDH and\
      \ National Library of Wales. Through hands-on exercises, we will allow attendees\
      \ to test some of the features of Madoc, particularly the display,\
      \ enrichment (e.g. annotations, translations, transcriptions, metadata\
      \ harvesting, ...) and curation of IIIF digital collections. The next\
      \ step is then to apply some of the findings of the first part of the workshop\
      \ to the platform, and particularly reflect on current features of\
      \ Madoc. Next, we will reflect in a group on (1) how current features\
      \ already are solutions for IIIF and crowdsourcing, as well as (2) potential\
      \ next requirements for the platform to cater to existing common needs. This\
      \ session will facilitate further development and direction of both\
      \ the Madoc community and platform. We will further refine the workshop\
