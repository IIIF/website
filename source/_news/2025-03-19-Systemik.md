The International Image Interoperability Framework Consortium is delighted to announce [Systemik Solutions](https://systemiksolutions.com/) has joined the Consortium as an Associate Member. Systemik developed the open source Glycerine viewer, which supports the Presentation API, as well as the Workbench, which provides annotation tools and end-to-end workflows for users to collaborate on projects across repositories. 

"Systemik is delighted to be accepted as a member of the consortium and is committed to the development and sustainability of IIIF.  We see expanding opportunities to explore scholarly annotation as research and curatorial practices, and enormous potential in the integration of generative AI into our [Glycerine](https://glycerine.io/) framework."   

“It’s a pleasure to welcome Systemik Solutions as an Associate Member of the IIIF-C. Ian McCrabb and his Australian-based team’s work on the Glycerine Viewer and the Glycerine workbench for the annotation and publishing of IIIF content provides an important solution for many institutions,” said Martin Kalfatovic, IIIF-C Managing Director. “Our work to date with Systemik has been productive and having them as an Associate Member will open up additional possibilities.”
