After five years at the helm of the IIIF Consortium, Managing Director Josh Hadro will be stepping down as of December 8, just after the conclusion of the [IIIF Online Meeting](https://iiif.io/event/2023/online-meeting/).

Tom Cramer, IIIF Executive Committee Board Chair and Associate University Librarian at Stanford University, says, "During Josh's tenure as IIIF-C's first Managing Director, the Consortium has stabilized, built resiliency, and developed a bold, strategic vision for the future. We're grateful for his leadership during this time of growth and maturation for the community."

Hadro says, “I’m incredibly gratified by the progress IIIF has made in the last five years. Our membership has grown, we’re seeing new innovations in the IIIF community particularly around guided storytelling and mapping tools in recent years, exciting progress toward 3D integration, and we have grown our staff to three FTE. I am excited to see what comes next for IIIF and its further adoption around the world.”

Hadro will share more details about his next role in early 2024; those interested can follow him on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/hadro)/[Mastodon](https://glammr.us/@hadro)/[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/hadro.bsky.social) under the handle @hadro. In the meantime, the [IIIF Executive Committee](https://iiif.io/community/consortium/consortium_committees/#executive-committee) is forming a search committee to hire someone new to the role of Managing Director. They intend to publish a job description in November of 2023, and seek applicants through mid-January of 2024.
