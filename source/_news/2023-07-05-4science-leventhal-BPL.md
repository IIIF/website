The International Image Interoperability Framework Consortium is delighted to announce two new members. [4Science](https://www.4science.com/) and [Boston Public Library](https://www.bpl.org/) (BPL) and its [Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center](https://www.leventhalmap.org/) (LMEC) have joined as Associate members. 

4Science supports universities, research institutes, and cultural institutions around the world in the management and implementation of digital projects. Since 2017 they have worked on the integration of IIIF APIs with DSpace, providing the first IIIF Image Viewer add-on module for DSpace and empowering access to digital objects in repositories for scholars, scientists and all citizens. 

Susanna Mornati, Chief Operating Officer of 4Science, says, _“By adhering to IIIF's shared API specifications, 4Science is simplifying the analysis, sharing, and dissemination of digitized materials. Scholars and researchers now have seamless access to high-quality images, enabling groundbreaking discoveries and collaborations. Joining the IIIF Consortium further strengthens our commitment to empowering institutions worldwide with cutting-edge technologies and fostering collaboration in the digital realm.”_ 

The Boston Public Library and Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center have undertaken a robust set of IIIF-powered initiatives, including the [LMEC’s Digital Exhibitions](https://www.leventhalmap.org/exhibitions/digital-exhibitions/), which leverage IIIF resources, and [BPL’s Digital Commonwealth portal](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/), which includes a description of available IIIF APIs. Together, they are also expanding the ecosystem of IIIF tools and infrastructure: the LMEC by supporting and expanding on [Allmaps](https://allmaps.org/), and BPL by maintaining [Blacklight IIIF Search](https://github.com/boston-library/blacklight_iiif_search). 

_“We see our collection as one part of a vast digital ecosystem of cultural works which tell the most powerful and compelling stories when they are brought together,”_ says Garrett Dash Nelson, President & Head Curator at the Leventhal Map & Education Center. _“The IIIF Consortium is one of the most important institutions for building shared tools around digital collections work.”_
