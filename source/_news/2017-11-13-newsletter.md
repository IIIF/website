## Community Events and Outreach

### IIIF Translations
In an effort to reach a broader and more international audience, IIIF community volunteers have been working on translating information about IIIF, such as the IIIF Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). Over the past few months, the [general IIIF FAQ][iiif-faq] has been translated into Spanish by Pedro Urra, Professor at Havana University, with the help of some team members of the Cuban National Library. In addition, both the general FAQ and the [IIIF Consortium FAQ][iiifc-faq] have also been translated into French by Régis Robineau, Biblissima Portal Coordinator, and Julien A. Raemy, Research Assistant at the HES-SO University of Applied Sciences in Geneva. [The translations][iiif-translations] are still work in progress and their authors are seeking help from the community to review them.  

### Europeana IIIF Task Force Report
The EuropeanaTech community IIIF Task Force has worked to better determine how Europeana and the Europeana Network as a whole should be involved with the IIIF community, and what kind of IIIF-related developments should be undertaken. After a final round of review, the task force has released their final report and recommendations at
<https://pro.europeana.eu/project/preparing-europeana-for-iiif-involvement>

### IIIF Showcase and Workshop at the V&A in London, November 2017

## Technical Work

### Transition from HTTP to HTTPS
Several institutions in the IIIF community, including University of Heidelberg, [Oxford Digital Bodleian][bod-https], [Harvard Art Museums][harvard-https], the [University of Edinburgh][edin-https], and the [Vatican Library][vat-https], among others, have switched from HTTP to HTTPS for their IIIF collections. Read the compelling [case for serving your IIIF content over HTTPS][jack-https] by Jack Reed (Stanford).

### IIIF Presentation 3.0 and A/V Technical Specification
As part of the ongoing “Save Our Sounds” project at the British Library, with a grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, representatives from the [IIIF A/V Technical Specification Group][av-group] and IIIF Editors met in late September at the Getty Center in Los Angeles to review proof of concept work on A/V implementations, discuss open issues related to the Presentation 3.0 spec, and prepare for the IIIF Working Meeting. The [IIIF A/V Technical Specification Group][av-group] then met in October at the IIIF Working Meeting in Toronto to ratify several issues for moving forward - see [notes][av-toronto-notes] from the meeting. Version 3.0 of the IIIF Presentation API will incorporate support for A/V interoperability.

### Discovery of IIIF Resources
The [IIIF Discovery Technical Specification Group][discovery-group] met in October at the IIIF Working Meeting in Toronto and decided to pursue Activity Streams as the best prospective approach for crawling and harvesting IIIF manifests - see [notes][disc-notes] from the meeting.

### IIIF Text Granularity Technical Specification Group
The [IIIF Text Granularity Technical Specification Group][textgran], chaired by Peter Binkley (University of Alberta) and Michael Appleby (Yale Center for British Art) met in person at the [IIIF Working Meeting in Toronto][toronto].  The group considered various levels of granularity and the difficulties of applying them to manuscript material or to some non-Western languages. The discussion has moved tentatively in the direction of considering text granularity as a specific example of the general problem of providing information about annotation lists so that users can decide what to do with them. There was also a call for additional use cases from the community; please feel free to submit additional text granularity use cases [via Github][text-github] or raise them for discussion on the biweekly call.

### Specifications Timeline
The following is the sequence and anticipated timeline for IIIF technical specifications agreed at the Toronto Working Meeting. Progress toward new specifications is contingent upon available community input, review, and the development of implementations demonstrating new features per the [Community Process][community-process].
* Presentation API 3.0 and Image API 3.0 -- Significant changes in the Presentation API to support A/V and also to change from Open Annotation to the now-standardized W3C Web Annotation model. The Image API will be updated at the same time because of parallel changes.
    * Feature freeze end-2017
    * Draft specifications May 2018 (in time for discussion at DC meeting)
    * Ratify and release Fall 2018
    * Community effort to create cookbook recipes and migration documentation
* Search API 2.0
    * Updates required to match Presentation API 3.0, especially related to the change from Open Annotation to the W3C Web Annotation model.
    * Start work after release of Presentation API 3.0 with anticipated release in 2019
* Auth API 1.1
    * Update with non-breaking improvements in 2019

## Community Groups:
IIIF Community groups are designed to provide a forum for general discussion, brainstorming, sharing of use cases and demos, and working to produce tutorials and presentations based on existing IIIF APIs. The process for forming Community Groups can be found at <{{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/community/groups/framework/>. Please see the [IIIF Community Groups page][groups] for a calendar of group and community calls, as well as links to more information about each group.

### Manuscripts Community Group
Continuing with discussions from the recent in-person meeting in Toronto, the [IIIF Manuscripts Community Group][manuscripts] has been working to identify best practices for manuscript metadata fields in order to provide a consistent user experience for manuscripts researchers.

### Museums Community Group
The [IIIF Museums Community Group][museums] continues to share IIIF use cases, new implementations have been released at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Clyfford Still Museum, and the National Gallery of Art, and the Victoria & Albert Museum recently hosted a IIIF event in conjunction with the Museum Computer Group (MCG) conference in the UK, and the Museum Computer Network (MCN) conference in the US featured many IIIF-related activities and discussion.

### Newspapers Community Group
The [IIIF Newspapers Community Group][newspapers] is now meeting once a quarter and focusing on demos and answering questions for implementers. The IIIF newspaper guide is near final stages and will be online soon. (A draft is available on github.)  Stay tuned to the [IIIF Discuss email list][iiif-discuss] for call scheduling announcements and drafts.  If you’re willing to give a demo, please suggest on the #newspaper slack channel or ping Karen Estlund or Glen Robson.

### Software Developers Community Group
The [IIIF Software Developers Community Group][devs-group] has created a [IIIF tag in StackOverflow][stackoverflow] and encourages questions in that forum to spread knowledge about IIIF. The group is still conducting a [survey][software-survey] to gauge the current interests and status of the IIIF developer community.
