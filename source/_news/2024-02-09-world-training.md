# IIIF World Training Events

Throughout March and April 2024, the IIIF Consortium will host a series of free online training sessions, delivered in several languages. These training sessions are aimed at beginners, with no technical expertise necessary. They provide a short and simple introduction to what IIIF is, how it works, and the multitude of use cases for IIIF resources in research, education, and communications. 

Each event is free, but advanced registration is required and space is limited.
