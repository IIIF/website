 Save the Date for the 2025 IIIF Annual Conference in Leeds, UK.

---
The IIIF Consortium is delighted to announce that the 2025 IIIF Annual Conference will be held June 2-5, 2025 and hosted by the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/). 

A free Showcase event will take place on June 2, followed by two full conference days on June 3 and 4, and workshops and networking sessions on June 5. 

We’ll be issuing a call for program committee volunteers in the coming months, but if you’re interested in helping us get in touch via staff@iiif.io.

Look for more details to come soon, and we hope you can join us in Leeds in 2025!
