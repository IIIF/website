The International Image Interoperability Framework Consortium is delighted to announce two new members. The [Canadian Research Knowledge Network](https://www.crkn-rcdr.ca/en) (CRKN) and the [National Film and Sound Archive of Australia](https://www.nfsa.gov.au/) (NFSA) have joined as Associate members. 

CRKN has implemented the IIIF image API to deliver items in the [Canadiana access platform](https://www.crkn-rcdr.ca/en/canadiana-collections), and developed a roadmap to further the collection’s interoperability with the Presentation API. “CRKN is delighted to join the IIIF consortium as an associate member,” said Clare Appavoo, CRKN’s Executive Director. “Implementing IIIF as the key technical foundation of our Canadiana infrastructure has been central to our plans to evolve into open, interoperable infrastructure that supports cutting-edge research on Canada’s past.”

NFSA is leading the charge for IIIF adoption in Australia, including hosting a IIIF workshop in conjunction with the [2024 Fantastic Futures conference](https://www.nfsa.gov.au/fantastic-futures-canberra-2024-artificial-intelligence-libraries-archives-and-museums). Keir Winesmith, Chief Digital Officer, National Film and Sound Archive of Australia said “the audiovisual archiving sector is currently experiencing fundamental changes, with new tools and archival practices unlocking and making discoverable more audiovisual heritage than ever before. Expert image annotation and machine learning will aid the NFSA in making Australian stories more accessible."
