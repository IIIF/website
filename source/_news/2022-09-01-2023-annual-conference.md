We're excited to be hosting the 2023 IIIF Annual Conference with our partners at the University of Naples Federico II.

The conference will take place the week of June 5, 2023, with exact dates for the Showcase, workshops, and conference sessions to be determined in the coming months.

We'll be issuing a call for program committee volunteers likewise in the coming months, but if you're interested in helping us get in touch via <staff@iiif.io>.

Look for more details to come soon about the event, and we hope you can join us in Naples in June 2023!
