 IIIF Consortium Announces Updated Membership Structure and Expanded Benefits for 2026

---

As the [International Image Interoperability Framework Consortium](https://iiif.io/) prepares for the year ahead, it is announcing updates to its membership structure for 2026. These changes address current economic pressures, including rising inflation and tightening institutional budgets, while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Consortium and enhancing the value provided to members.


### **Key Changes Effective 2026**

**Reduced Dues for Full Members**
Beginning in 2026, annual dues for Full Members will decrease from **$10,000 to $8,000**. This reduction, paired with expanded member benefits, reflects the Consortium’s commitment to accessibility and strengthened support for the global IIIF community. 

**Associate Member Dues Remain Steady**
Dues for Associate Members will remain **$2,500** in 2026. Some benefits have been right-sized to ensure responsible stewardship of resources and a more equitable distribution of member services across the Consortium.

**New Reduced Rate for Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)**
To further global access to IIIF resources, the Consortium is introducing a reduced **$1,000 Associate Member tier** for institutions located in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, as defined by the World Bank. This new category aligns with IIIF’s strategic vision to expand international participation and support inclusive community growth.

**New Champion Level of Support**
Members wishing to increase their commitment to the IIIF Consortium may opt to become **Champions**, contributing **$16,000 annually**. Champions will help advance key Consortium initiatives, development projects, and technical work, with the opportunity to direct their support toward areas of particular interest.

**Additional Add-ons**
Member organizations may pay an additional $2,000 toward one of **three new membership add-ons**: access to a new suite of [Allmaps](https://allmaps.org/iiif-partnership) tools for IIIF members, a strategic development fund, and a community development fund.

More information regarding membership tiers, associated benefits, and the new Allmaps-IIIF partnership is available on the [IIIF website](https://iiif.io/community/consortium/join/).
