The International Image Interoperability Framework Consortium is delighted to announce the French Ministry of Culture has joined the Consortium as a full member. 

The [Ministry of Culture](https://www.culture.gouv.fr/en) is leading the adoption of IIIF across French cultural institutions. In addition to implementing IIIF within its own internal digital infrastructure, the Ministry of Culture promotes IIIF to those institutions which it funds or supervises. These institutions span the cultural heritage sector including museums, archives, libraries, arts & crafts, and architecture. 

Recently, the Ministry of Culture has undertaken a variety of advocacy activities including: presenting IIIF to the CTOs of 80 public entities supervised by the the MInistry, supporting a joint workshop with [PICTORIA](https://pictoria.hypotheses.org/category/appels/appels-a-contribution) (a research consortium focused on image manipulation, bringing together research labs and cultural institutions)  to further joint-programs using IIIF, and a webinar with IT and digitization experts to solidify a national IIIF policy. 

“Having the French Ministry of Culture become a partner in the IIIF Consortium affirms their commitment to open standards and the importance of IIIF across the spectrum of cultural heritage organizations supported by the Ministry,” said Martin Kalfatovic, Managing Director of the IIIF Consortium.
