### Overview

In order to foster a conference environment that better reflects the diversity of the IIIF community, the IIIF Consortium is pleased to announce a travel scholarship to attend the [Annual Conference being held this year in Cambridge, MA, USA][conference]. The consortium will offer at least two travel scholarships this year.

### Guidelines

- Up to $2000 to reimburse travel, lodging, registration, and meals
- We can provide a letter of support/invitation
- Recipient is primarily responsible for booking and logistics, and for submitting expenses within 30 days of the conclusion of the conference (though if cash-flow is an issue IIIF-C can help with some coordination)  
- Note: All event proceedings at the conference will be in English unless otherwise noted in the program

## Criteria

Preference will be given to the following, in no specific order:

- First time attendees
- Candidates from under-represented groups in the IIIF Community (including but not limited to: women, people of color, LGBTQ+, ability/disability, non-binary gender identities, etc., as well as members of underrepresented and/or marginalized groups that don't fit into the categories listed above)[^code4lib_note]
- Attendees from under-represented countries and geographic regions, particularly the Global South
- Attendees from new IIIF-implementing institutions and projects

### Expectations

Recipients are expected to handle any paperwork requirements for travel to Cambridge, MA, but if letters of support or invitation are necessary IIIF-C will provide those upon request.

During the conference, recipients are expected only to be engaged participants, and there is no expectation of volunteer work or other duties other than session attendance.

There will also be additional opportunities for contact and connection, including possible mentorship opportunities to be finalized closer to the date of the conference.
