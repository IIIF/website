The 2022 [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/) Annual Conference will be held in Cambridge, MA, USA June 6â€“8, 2022, and will be hosted jointly by [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) and the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology ](https://mit.edu/)(MIT) along with the IIIF Consortium.

This event is intended for a wide range of participants and interested parties, including digital image repository managers, content curators, software developers, scholars, and administrators at libraries, museums, cultural heritage institutions, software firms, and other organizations working with digital images and audio/visual materials.

The event includes a free **showcase** meant to introduce newcomers to IIIF, and those seeking to learn how IIIF is used in a variety of contexts. The **conference** features plenary presentations and sessions about IIIF implementations around the world, including cutting edge use cases and demonstrations. Online **workshops** will offer more in-depth opportunities to learn about IIIF tools and platforms, and will be held the weeks before and after the event.

This event is guided by the IIIF [Code of Conduct]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/event/conduct).
