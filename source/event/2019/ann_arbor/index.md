### Accessibility notes

For Monday’s Showcase in [Rackham Amphitheatre][rackham]:

- There is a handicapped city parking meter on Washington Street, which runs along the front entrance to the Rackham building.
- The building is accessible from Washington Street via a ramp with a power door. The ramp is near the bicycle rack.
- There is an alternative drop off (out of the weather) for vehicles 90” or shorter off Huron Street (which runs behind the building. Huron Street is the main thoroughfare through town.) It is a one way semicircular drive that goes underneath the building. This is for drop-off only. There is no guest parking in this garage.
- The building has two banks of elevators, and both sets go to the 4th floor, which is where our events are located.
