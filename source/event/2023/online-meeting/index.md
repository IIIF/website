**The 2023 Online Meeting will take place December 5-7 and is free to attend.**

The Online Meeting is intended for a wide range of participants and interested parties, including digital image repository managers, content curators, software developers, scholars, and administrators at libraries, museums, cultural heritage institutions, software firms, and other organizations working with digital images and audio/visual materials.

As a counterpart to the IIIF in-person Annual Conference, this event is meant  both to introduce newcomers to IIIF and to provide a forum for discussion and dissemination for those with experience implementing and working with IIIF in a variety of contexts.

This event is guided by the [IIIF Code of Conduct][conduct].


## Logistics
* This event is free and open to all attendees.
<!-- * This event will be held using a single Zoom meeting for the sessions.   -->
* Presentations will be recorded. 
* All sessions will be in English unless otherwise noted.

## Registration
Registration is free! Sign up will take place via Eventbrite, and will open later this year.

## **Call for Proposals: Now Open**

The 2023 International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Online Meeting will be held **December 5-7**. This year’s meeting will follow a “Working and Learning” theme, with a program built to provide attendees with a look into new and innovative IIIF projects, implementations, developments, and tools, and opportunities to learn new skills. 

**Submissions are due by September 15, 2023**


## **Format**

The event organizers are looking for proposals in the following forms:

* Lightning talks (7 minutes)
* Online workshop/training sessions (up to 2 hours)


**Note:**

* Accepted lightning talks will be pre-recorded, though presenters are asked to be present during the online meeting if possible to participate in Q&A following the presentation.  
* Online workshops or training sessions should be interactive events with clearly stated target audiences and learning outcomes. 
* All submissions will be reviewed by a committee. This year, we will prioritize submissions from first-time presenters; likewise, while it is possible to submit multiple proposals, we will ask that any given speaker appear only once in the final program. 
* Final versions of the accepted abstracts and presentations will be made openly available after the conference.


## **Proposal themes**

**Lightning Talks**

We encourage showcasing developments in IIIF and in particular would welcome presentations in the following areas:

* IIIF implementations featuring unique or uncommon collections
* Interoperability in IIIF contexts
* IIIF Audio/Visual use cases and implementations
* Implementations of IIIF outside of North America/Europe
* Implementations of IIIF outside of Cultural Heritage
* Annotation, including full-text or academic use cases
* Guided storytelling and innovative exhibitions using IIIF
* Using IIIF material for Machine Learning and AI


**Workshops**

Workshop submissions must have an abstract, a proposed outline schedule, and desired outcomes (e.g., _“at this end of this session, participants will be able to place IIIF manifests on a web map”, or “at the end of this session, participants will be able to use IIIF manifests to create guided storytelling exhibitions”)._


## **Submissions**

Please submit proposals through Google Forms: https://forms.gle/j1NJxV8vBuf76FPp7
