# **Call for proposals now open: 2023 IIIF Online Meeting**

The 2023 International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Online Meeting will be held **December 5-7**. This year’s meeting will follow a “Working and Learning” theme, with a program built to provide attendees with a look into new and innovative IIIF projects, implementations, developments, and tools, and opportunities to learn new skills. 

**Submissions are due by September 15, 2023**


### **Format**

The event organizers are looking for proposals in the following forms:

* Lightning talks (7 minutes)
* Online workshop/training sessions (up to 2 hours)


**Note:**

* Accepted lightning talks will be pre-recorded, though presenters are asked to be present during the online meeting if possible to participate in Q&A following the presentation.  
* Online workshops or training sessions should be interactive events with clearly stated target audiences and learning outcomes. 
* All submissions will be reviewed by a committee. This year, we will prioritize submissions from first-time presenters; likewise, while it is possible to submit multiple proposals, we will ask that any given speaker appear only once in the final program. 
* Final versions of the accepted abstracts and presentations will be made openly available after the conference.


### **Proposal themes**

**Lightning Talks**

We encourage showcasing developments in IIIF and in particular would welcome presentations in the following areas:

* IIIF implementations featuring unique or uncommon collections
* Interoperability in IIIF contexts
* IIIF Audio/Visual use cases and implementations
* Implementations of IIIF outside of North America/Europe
* Implementations of IIIF outside of Cultural Heritage
* Annotation, including full-text or academic use cases
* Guided storytelling and innovative exhibitions using IIIF
* Using IIIF material for Machine Learning and AI


**Workshops**

Workshop submissions must have an abstract, a proposed outline schedule, and desired outcomes (e.g., _“at this end of this session, participants will be able to place IIIF manifests on a web map”, or “at the end of this session, participants will be able to use IIIF manifests to create guided storytelling exhibitions”)._


**Submissions**
