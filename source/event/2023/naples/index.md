This event is intended for a wide range of participants and interested parties, including digital image repository managers, content curators, software developers, scholars, and administrators at libraries, museums, cultural heritage institutions, software firms, and other organizations working with digital images and audio/visual materials.

The event includes a free **showcase** meant to introduce newcomers to IIIF, and those seeking to learn how IIIF is used in a variety of contexts. The **conference** features plenary presentations and sessions about IIIF implementations around the world, including cutting edge use cases and demonstrations. 

This event is guided by the IIIF [Code of Conduct]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/event/conduct).
