**Samvera Europe Annual Meeting, Friday 6th June 2025**

The Samvera Community is a global community of practice where library and technology professionals come together to support and learn from one another in the development of solutions for managing and delivering digital collections. Technologies created through the community include a range of repository software systems, such as Hyrax, Hyku and Avalon, and the IIIF solutions, CloverIIIF and  ServerlessIIIF.

The Samvera Europe community will hold its annual meeting at the University of Leeds in conjunction with the 2025 Annual IIIF Conference.  The meeting will showcase recent developments amongst European members of the Samvera Community as well as encompass discussion on topics of key current interest: a programme will follow. There is no charge for the meeting and all are welcome. The Samvera Community is grateful to the University of Leeds for their support in hosting the meeting.
