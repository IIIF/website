The 2025 International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Annual Conference will be held in-person in Leeds, United Kingdom, June 2–5, 2025. The conference will be hosted by the University of Leeds and the IIIF Consortium.

**Submissions are due by January 21, 2025.**


### **Format**

The IIIF Conference Program Committee invites proposals for presentation in the following formats:

* 7-minute lightning talks
* 15-minute presentations (plus 5 minutes for Q&A)
* Workshops (1–3 hours)
* Birds of a Feather sessions (these sessions are informal discussion groups that will each consider a specific issue or subject. You do not need to be an expert to propose a Birds of a Feather session, but you should have some experience and be prepared to facilitate the discussion. Rooms will be made available for each session. 1–3 hours.)



### **Proposal themes**

We encourage submissions in the following areas:

* Sustainability in IIIF contexts, including: environmental, institutional, and financial sustainability and longevity;
* Innovative IIIF use cases and implementations, including: scientific use cases and implementations outside of cultural heritage, interdisciplinary projects and implementations, 3D projects and developments, ludic or entertainment instances, and AI/ML use cases;
* Implementation of IIIF in teaching and learning contexts, especially projects with research and cultural impacts;
* Accessibility, including: disability access, equitable access to IIIF resources, long-term preservation of IIIF resources;
* To help celebrate the 10th anniversary of the IIIF Consortium, presentations on long-term implementations, applied IIIF, lessons learned from failures, and “feel good” IIIF stories.

Cross-institutional or interdisciplinary presentations are strongly encouraged.
