## Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA)

Attendees visiting Leeds from outside the United Kingdom and Ireland will need an Electronic Travel Authorization. **This is a *new* requirement for 2025.**

Please read the following guide for more information regarding who needs an ETA and how to apply on the [UK Visas and Immigration website](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-an-electronic-travel-authorisation-eta). Authorizations take 3-5 business days to process and you must apply before your travel date. 

## Travel by air
* The nearest airport is [Leeds Bradford (LBA)](https://www.leedsbradfordairport.co.uk/). Several major airlines fly to LBA routed through Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, and other European hubs.
