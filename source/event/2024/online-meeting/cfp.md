The [2024 International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Online Meeting](https://iiif.io/event/2024/online-meeting/) will be held **November 12-14**. This year’s meeting will follow a _Working and Learning_ theme, with a program built to provide attendees with a look into new and innovative IIIF projects, implementations, developments, and tools, as well as opportunities to learn new skills. 

**Submissions are due by September 3, 2024.**


### **Format**

The event organizers are looking for proposals in the following formats:

* Lightning talks (7 minutes)
* Online workshop/training sessions (up to 2 hours)

**Note:**

* Accepted lightning talks will be pre-recorded, though presenters are asked to be present during the online meeting if possible to participate in Q&A following the presentation.  
* Online workshops or training sessions should be interactive events with clearly stated target audiences and learning outcomes. 
* All submissions will be reviewed by a committee. This year, we will prioritize submissions from first-time presenters; likewise, while it is possible to submit multiple proposals, we will ask that any given speaker appear only once in the final program. 
* Final versions of the accepted abstracts and presentations will be made openly available after the conference.

* Implementations of IIIF outside of Cultural Heritage
* Annotation, including full-text or academic use cases
* New tools and platforms

Workshop submissions must have an abstract, a proposed outline schedule, and desired outcomes (e.g., “_at this end of this session, participants will be able to place IIIF manifests on a web map”, or “at the end of this session, participants will be able to use IIIF manifests to create guided storytelling exhibitions”). This year, seeking workshop proposals aimed at end users, researchers, and educators as well as workshops for experienced IIIF practitioners._
