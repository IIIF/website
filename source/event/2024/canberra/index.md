### Who is it for?

The IIIF Showcase is an event for people new to IIIF to get an overview and discover the latest developments in a single event. It assumes no previous experience with IIIF and will cover the full gamut of IIIF from the basics to Showcases of the latest developments in the IIIF Community.

## Workshops

For those that are interested in getting hands on with IIIF and learning how it works there will be two workshops available on October the 16th.

### Hands on with IIIF

9:00am - 12:00pm

<!-- [Registration][] -->

This session will introduce you to the IIIF Image and Presentation standards and go through some hands on exercises to show how you can create and use off the shelf tools to get started with these standards. We will discuss how to setup a IIIF system in production starting with a small collection and then how to scale up to millions of images. We will then conclude with a discussion on the wider IIIF community and where you can go for help and advice after the workshop has completed.

Attendees should leave the session with a good understanding of the different IIIF standards and what choices need to be looked at when setting up a IIIF system in their own institution. 

No prior knowledge of IIIF is required and the core sessions should be easily accessible to those with confidence using the Web. 

### Glycerine users

2:00pm - 4:00pm

<!--- [Registration][] -->

This session will introduce [Glycerine](https://glycerine.io/), a workbench for image annotation.  Annotations can combine semantic tags from domain specific vocabularies with critical analysis references. Researchers can collaborate across institutional repositories and publish the annotated images as research outputs. 

We will go through hands-on exercises to create your own collection of images, create annotations, and publish them.  In the second hour we will break out into research and implementation streams.  Researchers can discuss collection building and annotation methods; digital professionals can explore API access and integration of Glycerine workflows and viewer.
Attendees should leave the session with all the competencies to build and publish annotated image collections and a good understanding of the possibilities for integration of Glycerine at their own institution.

No prior knowledge is required, and the session should be easily accessible to those with confidence using the Web.

Glycerine received investment from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) as part of the HASS and Indigenous RDC CDL project. The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).
