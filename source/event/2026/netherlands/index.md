The 2026 International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Annual Conference will be held in the Netherlands June 1–4, 2026, and will be hosted by the IIIF Consortium with support from the [Dutch Digital Heritage Network](https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/en/).

This event is intended for a wide range of participants and interested parties, including digital image repository managers, content curators, software developers, scholars, and administrators at libraries, museums, cultural heritage institutions, software firms, and other organizations working with digital images and audio/visual materials.

In addition to the Conference, held June 2 and 3, the event includes a free Showcase on June 1. The Showcase is meant to introduce newcomers to IIIF, and those seeking to learn how IIIF is used in a variety of contexts. The conference features plenary presentations and sessions about IIIF implementations around the world, including cutting edge use cases and demonstrations. 

This event is guided by the IIIF Code of Conduct. More information regarding travel and accommodations, the call for proposals, and registration will be forthcoming.
