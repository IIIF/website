**The 2021 IIIF Annual Conference will take place online from June 22-24 and is free to attend.**

The event is intended for a wide range of participants, including digital image repository managers, content curators, software developers, scholars, and administrators at libraries, museums, and cultural heritage institutions, software firms, and other organizations working with digital images and audio/visual materials.

This event will include sessions that have been traditionally held at IIIF events, such as a newcomer welcome session, the Community Groups update, a roadmapping session, and presentations and lightning talks from the community.

In response to the lingering effects of the pandemic, it will also include the opportunity to host and attend regionally-focused online meetings aimed at networking and knowledge sharing with local attendees.
