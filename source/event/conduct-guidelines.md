## What to do when a report is received

* In-person: when a verbal report is received in-person, the person who received the initial report should take down the information listed in the reporting guidelines. The person may take immediate action if the situation poses an immediate threat. If a threat is not immediate, the person who received the initial report should locate at least one other Code of Conduct Team member to share the report and discuss next steps. All members of the Code of Conduct Team should then be alerted, with a plan to meet and discuss the complaint in question.
* Virtual: when a virtual report is received either through email, chat, or conference call, all members of the Code of Conduct Team should be alerted and incident information shared immediately if they have not been already. Discussion of the report may take place asynchronously via chat or email, or the Code of Conduct Team members may schedule a meeting to discuss the situation.

## Identification of Team members at in-person events

* At all in-person IIIF events, Code of Conduct Team members and/or local organizers will be identified with a special badge and introduced at the beginning of the event during the welcome so all participants know who they can go to in the event of a code of conduct violation.

## Identifying Conduct and Safety representatives at locally hosted events
* There may be in-person events where dedicated Code of Conduct Team members are not present. In this case, local organizers must designate at least 2 volunteers to serve as conduct and safety representatives for the event. These representatives will be supplied with special badges by IIIF staff ahead of time. Any reports received at local events should immediately be shared with the Code of Conduct Team for further investigation.

## Factors to consider in determining a course of action:

* Assessing the situation
    * What is the main complaint?
    * Was there any background or underlying context?
    * Who was involved?

* Determining violation
    * Did the behavior compromise any of the community norms or harassment behaviors listed in the code of conduct?

* Deciding on a course of action
    * Is this a first offense or repeat offense?
    * How many people were affected?

* How to be an effective helper/advocate at IIIF events
    * Maintain awareness of others around you
    * If you notice something odd, let someone else know, and pay attention
    * If someone reports a code of conduct violation to you, let a team member know immediately

* How to report an incident or other concerns effectively
    * Send an email to <iiif-conduct@googlegroups.com>
