## IIIF Showcase - Edinburgh - 3rd of December

On the 3rd of December, the University of Edinburgh, the National Library of Scotland and the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) will host a special day-long IIIF Showcase and workshops. The event will provide those new to IIIF and those experienced with the framework and its tool a first hand and hands-on day filled with plenty of opportunities for discussions around sharing digital heritage collections with the world.

The day will start with an introduction into IIIF with presentations from various international institutions who can showcase their latest developments. This will be followed in the afternoon by a choice of sessions detailed below before everyone is brought back together for a reception and report back at St Cecilia's Hall.

Please register soon so as not to miss out as capacity is limited.   

### What is IIIF?

Embraced by a growing number of the world’s leading research and cultural heritage organizations, IIIF provides an open framework for organizations to publish their image-based resources, to be viewed, cited, annotated and compared by any compatible image-viewing application.

### Who is it for?

This event will be valuable for cultural heritage, STEM institutions, repository and collection managers, software engineers; or for anyone engaged with image-based and soon A/V resources on the Web. If you have not been involved with IIIF in the past this is an opportunity to quickly get up to speed and understand the community and its benefits.

### What will I learn?

* How to adopt IIIF at your institution
* Leveraging open source software to get more out of your collection of images and video
* Use cases and best practices from IIIF adopters
* See the latest developments in the community including IIIF A/V

## Lunch

Lunch is not provided for this free event but there are many locations around the meeting venues where lunch can be purchased. Please see the [map provided][lunch].

## Afternoon Sessions

The afternoon showcase will be split into various workshops and meetings. All meetings will start at 2:00pm and finish around 5:00pm. There are two main locations for the afternoon. The archives meeting will be held in the National Library of Scotland but all other meetings will be in the University of Edinburgh Main Library. Please arrive 10 minutes before the sessions are to start if you are going to the University Main Library as you will have to go through reception and up to the 6th floor. 

### Museums
__Location:__ [Research Suite, Main University Library, George Square.][uni-map] Report to reception on the right hand side of the main doors, then proceed up to level 6 in the lifts.

This session will be focused on discussing the issues and solutions relating to implementing IIIF in Museums. It will begin with presentations from institutions who are either on the path to implementing or who are already reaping the benefits of IIIF.  This will be followed by a discussion of the Museum specific tools including the V&A cropping tool, Canvas Panel and conservation imaging. A more detailed program will be released closer to the time but presentations from institutions will include the Getty, Yale Center for British Art and Edinburgh University Museum.

This session will be open to all levels of experience and will be chance to get questions answered and make contacts with other museums who are on the path of implementation.

### Archives
__Location:__ [National Library of Scotland Board room, George IV Bridge][nls-map]

Archival collections can be some of the most exciting collections that can be digitised and made available to the public. The recently formed IIIF Archives community group has been actively discussing the best way to make these available over IIIF. This meeting will hear from practitioners who are working with IIIF to make their hierarchical content accessible and there will be opportunities to discuss the practical issues in mapping various archival standards to IIIF. If you are interested in making your archival collections available through an interoperable framework to increase use by the public and researchers please consider signing up for this session.

### Digital Humanities
__Location:__ [Digital Scholarship Centre, Main University Library, George Square.][uni-map] Report to reception on the right hand side of the main doors, then proceed up to level 6 in the lifts.

The wealth of digital content made available in recent times has increased to staggering proportions and the content made available using IIIF is an incredibly rich resource for digital humanities scholars. The IIIF community and framework combines the content of leading institutions being made freely available with the interoperability to be able to take this content and use it in compatible tools for annotation and analysis. Although there are sector leading tools available that are compatible with IIIF content including Mirador, Omeka, Recogito and GeoReferencer to name a few, there is still a large amount of untapped potential available for researchers.

This session will combine demonstrations of the research already being undertaken with IIIF resources along with a presentation from the University of Toronto who are providing a research infrastructure for academics to allow them to more easily work with IIIF content. There will be an opportunity to discuss future tools and collaborations that can increase the use of IIIF content by digital humanities scholars.  This workshop will be lead by Dr. Beatrice Alex Edinburgh University, Professor Andrew Prescott University of Glasgow, Dr Benjamin Albritton Stanford University and Andrew Corrigan, Cambridge University.

### Technical hands on workshop
__Location:__ [5th Floor seminar room, Main University Library, George Square.][uni-map] Report to reception on the right hand side of the main doors, then proceed up to level 6 in the lifts. Staff will then be able to guide you down to the 5th floor.

This a hands on working session facilitated by IIIF’s technical coordinator Glen Robson. The goal of this hands on session is to offer those new to IIIF a crash course in implementing the Framework, allowing them to go back to their institutes with something to show and first-hand experience.

Participants are encouraged to bring their own images and will receive training on the image and presentation APIs and will:

* Install Cantaloupe, one of the popular IIIF Image servers
* Craft a manifest to view their images in one of the IIIF clients Mirador and the Universal Viewer.
* Look at annotations with IIIF resources
* Other areas of IIIF which are of interest to the participants

Participants will not need previous experience with IIIF but will need to bring a laptop with some prerequisites installed.

### IIIF Specifications In-depth Workshop
__Location:__ [Teaching room, Main University Library, George Square.][uni-map] Report to reception on the right hand side of the main doors, then proceed up to level 6 in the lifts.

This session is a deeper dive into the IIIF API specifications, allowing implementers and developers to understand the rationale behind the design and gain a richer understanding of the capabilities of the four APIs.  In particular, we will start with the design guidelines, then look at the Image and Presentation version 2 APIs, and the differences with the version 3 APIs. If there's time, we will look at Authentication and the Search Within APIs, plus a discussion of the forthcoming Change Discovery API. There will be plenty of opportunity for questions and discussion. The difference between this session and the hands-on workshop is that this will provide understanding of what the specifications do and is intended for implementers of services and tools, whereas the workshop will provide understanding of existing tools that already implement the specifications and is intended for institutions looking to adopt those tools.

## Reception at St Cecilia's Hall
__Location:__ [St Cecilia's Hall, 50 Niddry Street, Edinburgh, EH1 1LG][stCs-map]
Map: https://goo.gl/maps/kifsKPh1e5o 

Local hosts will be able to guide you from the afternoon sessions to St Cecilia’s Hall.

St Cecilia’s Hall is the oldest purpose-built concert hall in Scotland, and the second oldest (after Oxford’s Holywell Room) in the British Isles. The original building dates from 1763. Today the building consists of a modern entrance, visible conservation studio, four museum galleries, an education room and of course, the eighteenth-century concert room.
