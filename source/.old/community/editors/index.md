The IIIF Editorial Committee works in collaboration with [community groups][groups-framework] to propose new technical specifications and to update existing ones. The [Technical Review Committee (TRC)][trc] enables the timely review of these proposals.

## Selection
{: #selection}

The initial membership of the Editorial Committee was set in [Memorandum of Understanding][mou] that established the IIIF Consortium in 2015.

Per the [Memorandum of Understanding][mou], the editors may nominate additional editors at any time. All current editors must agree before an invitation is issued. Editors will choose from participants within the community and/or experts willing to lend their knowledge and experience to new specifications. Opportunities to better the gender, race, and age balance of the existing editorial team will also be a consideration. New editors must be approved by the IIIF Executive Group.

There is no set number of editors, but this does not mean that the number of existing editors will not be taken into account when considering new editors. The existing editors will seek out new or additional editors when they are lacking knowledge or significant empathy for use cases in an area that the community has agreed is important.

## Process

Editors must agree to follow the [IIIF editorial process][editorial-process], including attendance at meetings, and to the [intellectual property conditions under which the specifications are published][spec-disclaimer]. They are responsible for confirming that these conditions are also acceptable to their employer, where applicable.

It is not expected that every editor comment on every issue, though they should make every effort to do so. Editors may be dismissed from work on a specification, or the editorial group altogether, when they fail to meet the expectations of their colleagues, as described here.
