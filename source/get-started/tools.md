These tools offer user interfaces for working with IIIF resources in various ways--such as creating exhibitions, annotating images, and more--and often only require a link to one or more IIIF Manifests to use (see our [Guide to Finding IIIF resources]({{ site.guides_url | absolute_url }}/finding_resources/) for details).

If you find these helpful, you may also want to explore the [IIIF Awesome list][awesome]{:.external} for even more links to tools, demos, tutorials, and other resources.
