# Training / Outreach


![IIIF pins]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2019-06-IIIF-Conference-0705.jpg "IIIF pins")

## Online workshops
We regularly offer [online workshops]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/training+outreach/online_training) led by expert instructors. These are one week long and cover working with the Image and Presentation APIs, and annotating images, through asynchronous learning, Zoom meetings, and a dedicated Slack channel.

## Self-directed learning
You can use our [workshop training site](https://training.iiif.io/iiif-online-workshop/) to learn about IIIF on your own. 

To learn how to use existing IIIF materials for research or teaching, visit our [explainer](https://medium.com/@IIIF_io/how-to-use-iiif-resources-and-image-viewers-bd378a68b013) on using IIIF resources and viewers.

## Teach others about IIIF
If you are already familiar with IIIF and want to help others learn, you can use our [outreach materials]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/training+outreach/outreach_materials) to get started on presentations and information sharing. (If you find yourself doing this often, consider joining our [IIIF Ambassador Program][linkTK]!)

## LYRASIS partnership

IIIF and [LYRASIS](https://www.lyrasis.org/Leadership/Pages/LYRASIS-Learning.aspx) are working together to create online training on IIIF. One upcoming session is currently scheduled:
