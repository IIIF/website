IIIF is a community-driven framework for digital resource interoperability that thrives on input, participation and contributions from a diverse range of individuals and institutions. The [IIIF Consortium][consortium] (IIIF-C) exists to support IIIF. Its functions are funding, managing staff, holding intellectual property, and executing contracts in addition to sustained community outreach and communications. IIIF-C members are both participants in IIIF and provide funding resources in the form of membership fees. IIIF-C itself is governed by the IIIF Executive Committee. Additional groups are needed to ensure that the IIIF community continues to move forward in a sustainable, community-driven, coordinated way. 

To this end, the community created the IIIF Coordinating Committee, often referred to as "CoCo."

CoCo is composed of both IIIF-C members and non-members to represent constituents throughout the community. The group is meant to be large enough to generate ideas and energy for building a strong corps of IIIF leaders spanning all sectors, allowing for continuity over time, and regularly cycling in new leaders to bring a diversity of perspectives. The Coordinating Committee actively and continuously engages in maintaining and supporting the inclusion of a wide variety of persons and institutions with varying backgrounds, each of whom/which share a devotion to the fundamental purposes of the International Image Interoperability Framework.  

CoCo membership includes representatives from each [Community Group][groups] (can be a group co-chair, but is not required), [Technical Specification Group][groups] (TSG), the [Editorial Committee][editors], and [IIIF-C staff][staff].

The agenda for each meeting is compiled by the Managing Director and other IIIF-C staff, with support from the other committee members, based on issues raised in communication forums and topics related to:

- Assessing proposals for new community and technical groups
- Advising on strategic planning and communication across IIIF groups
- Advising on strategies for diverse representation across the IIIF community
- Discussing and advising on best practices for evolving communication
- De-briefing on and assessing success of IIIF events, conferences and working meetings
- Advising on location selection and timing of meetings
- Ratify revisions to the Code of Conduct (as proposed by the Code of Conduct team)
- Recommending policy additions or revisions where appropriate
- Monitoring and supporting the health of community groups

The Managing Director and other IIIF-C staff will serve as liaisons to the Executive Committee. 

CoCo meets monthly.
