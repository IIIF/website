The ambassador program deputizes community members to champion IIIF adoption in their communities. Ambassadors focus their efforts around different domains, associations, tools, or regions and meet with IIIF-C staff periodically to provide updates and feedback.


## Current ambassadors:
**Evelien Hauwaerts,Curator Medieval Manuscripts, Openbare Bibliotheek Brugge**<br/>
Evelien serves as the curator of manuscripts at the Public Library of Bruges and is a steering member of the IIIF Network Group Flanders & Netherlands. She co-curated the Mmmonk.be project in 2022, which delved into IIIF-driven metadata aggregation and complex IIIF annotations. Drawing from her experience as both a collection manager and researcher, Evelien aims to bridge the gap between IIIF end-users and developers. She developed and hosts a workshop to introduce IIIF to end-users, gathering valuable feedback that is then relayed to developers for enhancing user experience and interface design. Evelien has a Ph.D. in Medieval languages and literature (Université de Poitiers), a master’s degree in Romance languages (KU Leuven), and two research master’s degrees in Medieval History (KU Leuven and Université de Poitiers).

**Roger Hyam, Biodiversity Data Systems Developer, Royal Botanical Garden Edinburgh, Scotland**  
Roger trained as a botanist, completing a PhD in the molecular systematics of the genus Rhododendron in the 1990s, but became increasingly involved in data science and software. He crossed to the commercial software development world for a few years in the early 2000s before returning to the hybrid field of biodiversity informatics and working for the standards organisation TDWG. He is now on staff at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh where he continues his interest in the mechanics of sharing biodiversity data between organisations. Currently he is working on an EU funded project to encourage adoption of IIIF by natural history collections.

**Joe Song, IntelliJourney, Shanghai, China**   
Joe is a Digital Humanities enthusiast, independent software vendor, and Fudan University alumnus. Inspired by the vision of IIIF, he aims to introduce Chinese ancient scripts, paintings, and calligraphies to the whole world. As a nation that is proud of its continuous culture of 5000 years, China has a huge amount of cultural heritage waiting to be transformed into an interoperable form. With that goal in mind, Joe is especially interested in implementing IIIF in large scale scenarios, such as writing a cloud-native image server or enabling editing millions of images and publishing them in one click. Joe hopes more and more universities, colleges, and institutions in China will become part of the IIIF family and enjoy the fruits of unprecedented academic freedom.
