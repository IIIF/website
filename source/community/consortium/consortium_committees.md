## Executive Committee

Steering strategic direction and budget approval, this committee meets twice annually. Initially it was composed of staff from the first eleven founding members of the Consortium, plus two additional elected members. Starting in 2021, institutional seats on this committee are elected annually by the Consortium membership to staggered terms.

Appointments are on an institutional basis, and staff at each organization may select one or more person to represent the institution at Executive Committee meetings. 

The Executive Committee is currently working on developing a [new iterative strategic framework](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JMCLToTlijx3ztiPoKigEdmS2je_fYjU0kj-pxhgaM8/edit#slide=id.g2542c596307_0_77) to help focus the efforts of the Consortium in supporting the broader IIIF community.
