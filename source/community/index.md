# Join a vibrant community
There are lots of ways to get involved with IIIF, and not all require coding skills! The IIIF community has many facets focusing on international outreach, affinity groups, developing the APIs, and more.

## Community and Technical Specification Groups
IIIF Groups meet regularly to discuss various contexts of IIIF usage for a particular idea or initiative from technical and non-technical perspectives. View a full list of active and completed croups along with their charters, chairs, and meeting times [on the Groups page][groups].

All our work is guided by our [Code of Conduct]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/event/conduct/).

## Editorial Committee

The IIIF Editorial Committee meets regularly and works in collaboration with [Community and Technical Specification Groups][groups] to propose new technical specifications and to update existing ones. Learn about their work and current membership [on the Editors page][editors].

## Coordinating Committee (CoCo)

The [IIIF Coordinating Committee][coco] (known as "CoCo") ensures that the IIIF community continues to move forward in a sustainable, community-driven, coordinated way. CoCo is composed of both IIIF-C members and non-members to represent constituents throughout the community, and advises on many IIIF activities including policies, new group formation, and the overall health of community groups. 

## IIIF Ambassadors
IIIF Ambassadors are deputized to work with Consortium staff to take a formal role in championing IIIF adoption in their communities. Ambassadors focus their efforts around different domains, associations, tools, or regions. Learn more about [program and the current Ambassadors][ambassadors].

## IIIF Consortium

IIIF is supported by a membership [consortium]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/community/consortium), with members from all over the world including Stanford University, Europeana, Kansai University, and many more. In addition to supporting the IIIF community financially, these institutions contribute to the APIs, Community Groups, and more.
