## About

The Manuscripts Group formed following an [IIIF meeting in Ghent][ghent], Belgium in December 2015. Attendees at the Ghent meeting agreed that there needed to be a separate interest group focused on the experience of users working with images of hand-written materials in particular.

The IIIF community is constantly expanding; it covers a range of disciplines, institutions, research and national libraries, and non-profit image repositories. The IIIF Manuscripts Group currently welcomes participation from all IIIF repositories with manuscript materials, scholars working with hand-written materials, and software developers interested in the particular problems presented by those materials.

## Goals

The IIIF Manuscripts Group seeks to advance aims of the [IIIF Consortium][iiifc], which are to reduce inefficiency and needless redundancy born from incompatibility in the current image delivery ecosystem. The group is committed to furthering the [goals of IIIF][about], as well as its own specific goals:

  * To keep interested institutions and projects up to date on advances in the IIIF initiative as they affect users of digitized manuscripts
  * To provide feedback to the IIIF community on repository and user experience from the perspective of manuscript curators and scholars
  * To devise, organize, and promote noteworthy scholarship based on interoperable digitized manuscript data.
