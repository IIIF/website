## About
The Authentication API is an interaction pattern for managing access control to IIIF image resources. With the introduction of support for A/V in the IIIF Presentation API version 3 there is now a need to support authenticating resources which do not require a IIIF Image API service, as well as general updates for consistency with the new APIs. There have also been developments in the browser community that cause difficulties with the existing authentication specification. With the current specification being broken in some browsers, and soon to be obsolete in others, there is an urgent need to update the method in which the IIIF Authentication API works to remain useful in the evolving web landscape.

The [IIIF Authentication Technical Specification Group charter]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/community/groups/auth-tsg/charter/) provides an outline and timeline for anticipated work.
