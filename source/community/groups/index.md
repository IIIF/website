Community Groups provide an opportunity for discussing and advancing IIIF-related issues with peers. They meet regularly and **are open to all**.

If you'd like to propose a technical or community topic that would benefit the community, please review the [Groups framework]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/community/groups/framework).

## Current Groups

All of the meetings for the groups listed below are open to the public and can be joined at any time -- newcomers welcome!

### Community Groups

Community Groups meet to discuss issues related to current themes and topics, and also often feature demos of relevant work and recent implementations.
{% assign community = site.data.groups | where_exp: "group","group.type == 'community'" %}
{% for group in community %}
 * [{{group.label}}]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}{{group.link}}) - {{group.meeting_frequency }}
{% endfor%}
